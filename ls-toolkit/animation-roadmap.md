## üöß PHASE 1: ParticleFactory Integration & Testing

### Task 1.1: Basic ParticleFactory Integration ‚è≥
**Goal:** Get ParticleFactory working with existing AnimationProvider
**Test:** See realistic particles arranged by state when changing materials

**Steps:**
1. **Add ParticleFactory import to AnimationProvider.tsx**
   ```typescript
   import { ParticleFactory } from '../core/ParticleFactory';
   ```

2. **Replace engine.addParticles() calls with ParticleFactory**
   - In AnimationProvider initialization useEffect
   - In PhysicsEngine.setSubstance() method

3. **Test Command:** Run existing physics test screen
   - Should see particles arranged in grid (solid), clustered at bottom (liquid), or spread out (gas)
   - Change substance and verify particles recreate correctly

**Definition of Done:** Particles visually behave differently for solid/liquid/gas states

---

### Task 1.2: State Transition Testing ‚è≥
**Goal:** Smooth transitions between states when heating/cooling
**Test:** Heat water from ice ‚Üí liquid ‚Üí vapor with smooth particle transitions

**Steps:**
1. **Add temperature change handler to AnimationProvider**
   ```typescript
   const handleTemperatureChange = useCallback((newTemp: number) => {
     const newState = ParticleFactory.determineState(substanceKey, newTemp);
     if (newState !== currentState) {
       const updatedParticles = ParticleFactory.updateParticlesForNewState(
         particles, newState, newTemp, width, height
       );
       engineRef.current.particles = updatedParticles;
     }
     setParams({ temperature: newTemp });
   }, [particles, substanceKey, width, height]);
   ```

2. **Test Command:** Use temperature slider in test screen
   - Ice (< 0¬∞C): Particles form grid pattern
   - Water (0-100¬∞C): Particles cluster at bottom
   - Steam (> 100¬∞C): Particles spread throughout with upward burst

**Definition of Done:** Smooth visual transitions between all three states

---

### Task 1.3: Multiple Material Testing ‚è≥
**Goal:** Verify ParticleFactory works with different materials
**Test:** Switch between H2O, C2H5OH, CuSO4 and see different properties

**Steps:**
1. **Add material selector to test screen**
2. **Test each material's:**
   - Color (from materials.ts)
   - State transition temperatures
   - Particle size/mass differences

**Definition of Done:** Each material shows distinct visual properties

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: Atomic View Component

### Task 2.1: Create Basic AtomicView Component ‚è≥
**Goal:** Dedicated component for particle visualization
**Test:** Same particles render in new component

**Steps:**
1. **Create AtomicView.tsx**
   ```typescript
   export const AtomicView = ({ width, height }) => {
     const { particles } = useAnimation();
     return (
       <Canvas style={{ width, height }}>
         {particles.map(particle => (
           <Circle
             key={particle.id}
             cx={particle.x}
             cy={particle.y}
             r={particle.radius}
             color={particle.color}
           />
         ))}
       </Canvas>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Test Command:** Replace current particle rendering with AtomicView
   - Should see identical particle behavior

**Definition of Done:** AtomicView renders particles identically to current system

---

### Task 2.2: Add Particle Interaction ‚è≥
**Goal:** Drag individual particles
**Test:** Touch and drag particles, they should move and physics should respond

**Steps:**
1. **Add GestureDetector to AtomicView**
2. **Connect to useAnimation drag handlers**
3. **Test:** Drag particles and verify they respond to physics

**Definition of Done:** Can drag particles and they interact with physics engine

---

### Task 2.3: Add Educational Overlays ‚è≥
**Goal:** Show molecular information
**Test:** Toggle to show chemical formulas next to particles

## üìã TESTING STRATEGY

### After Each Task:

2. **Visual Test:** Changes are visible and clear
3. **Integration Test:** New code doesn't break existing features
4. **Performance Test:** No significant slowdown
5. **Error Test:** Graceful handling of edge cases

### Debug Protocol:
1. **Isolate:** Test new component separately first
2. **Integrate:** Add to existing system gradually
3. **Fallback:** Keep previous working version as backup
4. **Log:** Add console.logs for state tracking during development
