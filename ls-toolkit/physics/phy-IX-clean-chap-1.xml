        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-cd-p1" type="paragraph">Physical quantities are measurable features of matter and natural phenomena that can be expressed numerically using instruments and standard units, while non-physical quantities are characteristics that cannot be measured directly with instruments and depend on human perception or interpretation.</content>

      <section type="explanation" title="Explanation">
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-exp-p1" type="paragraph">Physics is fundamentally built upon the study of physical quantities - measurable aspects of our natural world. These quantities form the foundation through which we express the laws and principles of physics. A physical quantity always consists of two essential components: a numerical magnitude and a unit of measurement.</content>
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-exp-p2" type="paragraph">Physical quantities can be measured directly using instruments such as rulers for length, clocks for time, thermometers for temperature, and balances for mass. They can also be measured indirectly through calculations based on other measured quantities. For example, while we can directly measure the distance traveled and time taken, we calculate speed by dividing distance by time.</content>
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-exp-p3" type="paragraph">Non-physical quantities represent human experiences, emotions, and subjective interpretations that cannot be quantified using standard measuring instruments. These include love, beauty, wisdom, fear, and affection. While these qualities are real and significant in human experience, they cannot be expressed with numerical values and units in the same way physical quantities can.</content>
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-exp-p4" type="paragraph">Non-physical quantities can sometimes be described qualitatively or compared using predetermined criteria, indices, or survey techniques. For instance, beauty might be rated on a scale, but this rating is subjective and varies between individuals, unlike the objective measurement of physical quantities.</content>
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-exp-p5" type="paragraph">The distinction between physical and non-physical quantities is crucial in physics because it defines what can be studied scientifically through measurement and experimentation versus what belongs to other fields of human knowledge and experience.</content>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-av-item1" type="analogy" title="Library Catalog System">
          <paragraph>Library Catalog System: Physical quantities are like books in a library that can be precisely cataloged with specific information - title, author, number of pages, publication date. Each book has measurable, objective characteristics. Non-physical quantities are like the "atmosphere" or "mood" of the library - you can sense whether it's peaceful or bustling, but you can't measure these feelings with instruments.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-av-item2" type="analogy" title="Recipe vs Cooking Experience">
          <paragraph>Recipe vs Cooking Experience: Physical quantities are like the measurable ingredients in a recipe - 2 cups flour, 350°F temperature, 30 minutes baking time. These can be precisely measured and replicated. Non-physical quantities are like the "love" put into cooking or how "delicious" the final dish tastes - real experiences that can't be measured with kitchen instruments.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>1. Classification Challenge: Look around your classroom and identify 10 different things you observe. Classify each as either a physical quantity (something you could measure) or a non-physical quantity (something you experience but can't measure). For each physical quantity, suggest what instrument you would use to measure it.</paragraph>

            <question>
              <paragraph>3. Analysis: Explain why "pain level" is considered a non-physical quantity even though doctors often ask patients to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10. How does this differ from measuring temperature with a thermometer?</paragraph>
            </question>
            <answer><paragraph><emphasis type="italic">Answer: Pain level is subjective and depends on individual perception - the same injury might feel like a "5" to one person and "8" to another. Temperature measurement is objective and reproducible - a thermometer will give the same reading regardless of who uses it. Pain scales help communication but don't represent true physical measurement.</emphasis></paragraph></answer>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-rwa-item1" type="application_item" title="Medical Diagnostics">
          <paragraph>Hospitals rely heavily on physical quantities for diagnosis and treatment. Doctors measure blood pressure (120/80 mmHg), heart rate (70 beats per minute), body temperature (37°C), and blood glucose levels (90 mg/dL). These precise measurements help detect diseases and monitor patient health. However, doctors also consider non-physical quantities like patient anxiety or pain levels, which require subjective assessment and influence treatment decisions.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-rwa-item2" type="application_item" title="Sports and Fitness">
          <paragraph>Athletic performance is largely measured through physical quantities: runners' times (9.58 seconds for 100m world record), jump heights (2.45m high jump record), weights lifted (263kg clean and jerk record). Fitness trackers measure steps taken, calories burned, and heart rate. However, non-physical aspects like team spirit, determination, and sportsmanship are equally important but cannot be measured numerically.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-rwa-item3" type="application_item" title="Weather Forecasting">
          <paragraph>Meteorologists measure numerous physical quantities: temperature (-40°C to 50°C), atmospheric pressure (980-1040 hPa), wind speed (0-300+ km/h), humidity (0-100%), and rainfall (mm per hour). These measurements enable accurate weather predictions that help farmers, pilots, and the general public plan their activities. The "feel" of weather or how "pleasant" a day is remains subjective and non-physical.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-rwa-item4" type="application_item" title="Construction and Engineering">
          <paragraph>Building safe structures requires precise measurement of physical quantities: concrete strength (25-40 MPa), steel beam lengths (exact measurements), foundation depths, and load-bearing capacities. Engineers use instruments to measure stress, strain, and material properties. However, architectural beauty and the "feel" of a space are non-physical quantities that architects consider when designing buildings for human comfort and aesthetics.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-conn-item1" type="connection_item" title="Connection to Scientific Method">
          <paragraph>Physical quantities form the basis of the scientific method. Scientists make hypotheses about measurable phenomena, design experiments to test these hypotheses, and collect quantitative data. The ability to measure physical quantities objectively allows science to be reproducible and verifiable across different laboratories and researchers worldwide.</paragraph>
        </content>
        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-conn-item2" type="connection_item" title="Connection to Mathematics">
          <paragraph>Physical quantities provide the link between physics and mathematics. When we express physical laws mathematically (like F = ma), we're relating different physical quantities through mathematical relationships. This connection allows us to make predictions and solve practical problems using mathematical tools.</paragraph>

        <content id="ch1-topic1.1-sec-conn-item3" type="connection_item" title="Connection to Technology">
          <paragraph>Modern technology depends entirely on precise measurement of physical quantities. Computer processors operate at specific frequencies (GHz), smartphones have defined screen sizes (inches), and internet speeds are measured in data rates (Mbps). The development of more sensitive measuring instruments continues to drive technological advancement.</paragraph>

        <content type="fun_fact" id="1.1.ff2">
          <paragraph>2. The human eye can detect a single photon of light under ideal conditions, making it one of the most sensitive measuring instruments in existence. Yet we can't measure the "beauty" of what we see with any instrument.</paragraph>
        </content>
        <content type="fun_fact" id="1.1.ff3">
          <paragraph>3. Ancient civilizations used body parts as standard units of measurement - the "foot," "cubit" (forearm length), and "pace" (step length). This caused confusion in trade until standardized units were developed, showing why objective physical quantities are essential for communication.</paragraph>
