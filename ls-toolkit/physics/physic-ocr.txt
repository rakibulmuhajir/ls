We are living in a physical world where we observe many natural
phenomena and objects around us such as Sun, stars, moon, oceans, plants,
winds, rains, etc. People have always been curious to know the reality of such
happenings. This has led certain people to investigate the facts and laws working
in this world. This field of observation and experimentation to understand about
the world around us is known as science. Everything in our lives-is closely linked
to science and the discoveries made by the scientists. In order to obtain reliable
results from experiments, the primary thing is to make accurate measurements.
Physical quantities and their measurements have always been the matter
of interest for the scientists. They have been’ investigating to improve the
methods and instruments for accurate measurements of the physical quantities.
In this chapter, we will discuss physical quantities, their measurements and
related contents.
[Topic 1.1 Physical and Non-Physical Quantities]
We describe various natural phenomenon, events and human behaviour
using some of their features and terms such as love, affection, fear, wisdom,
beauty, length, volume, density, time, temperature, etc. Some of these can be
measured directly and indirectly using some tools and Quick Quiz
instruments such as length of an object using a ruler, time or the
duration of an event using a clock, the temperature (the dimensioned
degree of hotness) of somebody using a thermometer.
They are called physical quantities. The foundation of physics rests upon physical
quantities through which the laws and principles of physics are expressed.
Other quantities quoted above such as love, affection, fear, wisdom, and
beauty cannot be measured using tools and instruments. They often pertain to
the perception or interpretation of the observer. They can be described or

qualitatively or compared using some pre-determined criteria, indices or
through survey techniques. Non-physical quantities mostly help to understand
and to analyse human behaviour, emotions and social interactions.

[Topic 1.2 Base and Derived Physical Quantities]
Physics is a science of physical world where we interact with many
different types of material objects. These objects are exposed in terms of their
measurable features known as physical quantities such as length, breadth,
thickness, mass, volume, density; time, temperature, etc. Out of these, the
scientists have selected arbitrarily some quantities to play a key role. They are
called base quantities. All the quantities which can be described in terms of one
or more base quantities are called derived physical quantities. For example,
speed is a derived quantity which depends on distance and time which are base
quantities whereas density of a material is described in terms of mass and
volume.
A physical quantity measurement is a process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a
widely accepted standard quantity.
The teacher should facilitate this activity and initiate discussion as per direction.
One student should measure the length of a writing board with his hand. The same should
be repeated by four or five students. Are all the measurements same? If they differ, then
why? What is the solution to avoid confusion?

In the early days people used to measure length using hand or arm, foot
or steps. This measurement may result in confusion as the measurement of
different people may differ from
each other because of different
sizes of their hands, arms or steps.
To avoid such confusion, there is a
need of a standard so that
measurement by any person may
result the same. This standard of
measurement is known as a unit.
A measurement consists of two
parts, a number and a unit. A
measurement without unit is
meaningless.
Not very far in the past, every
country in the world had its own
units of measurements. However,
problems were faced when people
of different countries exchanged scientific information or traded with other
countries using different units, Eventually, people got the idea of standardizing
the units of measurements-which could be used by all countries for efficient
working and growth of mutual trade, business and share scientific information.
[Topic 1.3 International System of Units]
The international committee on weights and measures in 1961 recommended
the use of a system consisted of seven base physical
units known as international system of units,
abbreviated as SI. This system is in use all over
the world.
Use of SI measurements helps all
scientists to share and compare their
observations and results easily. The seven
base units are given in Table 1.2. Their values
are fixed with reference to international

‘SI Prefixes
The Slis a decimal system:-Prefixes are used to write units by powers of 10.
The big quantities like 50000000 m and small quantities like 0.00004 m are not
convenient to write down. The use of prefixes makes them simple. The quantity
50000000 m can be written as 5 x 10’ m. Similarly, the quantity 0.00004 m can be
written as4 x 10°m)
Prefixes.are the words or symbols added before SI unit such as milli,
centi, kilo, mega, giga (Table1.4). The prefixes given in Table 1.4 should be
known for use of SI units effectively. For example, one thousandth (1/1000) of
a metre is millimetre. The thickness of a thin wire can be expressed
conveniently in millimetres whereas a long distance is expressed in kilometres
which is 1000 metres.
Multiples and sub-multiples of mass measurement are given in Table 1.5
whereas multiples and sub-multiples of length are given in Table 1.6. The
following examples will explain the meaning of prefixes.

[Topic 1.4 Scientific Notation]
It is short way of representing very large or very small numbers. Writing
otherwise, the values of these quantities, take up much space They are difficult to read, their
relative sizes are difficult to visualize and they are awkward to use in calculations. Their
decimal places are more conveniently expressed as powers of 10. The numerical part
of the quantity is written as a number from 1 to
9 multiplied by whole number powers of 10. To
write numbers using scientific notation, move
the decimal point until only one non-zero
digit remains on the left. Then count the
number of places through which the decimal
point is moved and use this number as the
power or exponent of 10. The average
distance from the Sun to the Earth is
138,000,000 km. In scientific notation, this
distance would be written as 1.38 x 10° km.
The number of places the decimal moved to the
left is expressed as a positive exponent of 10. [Quick Quiz]
Diameter of hydrogen atom is about
0.000,000,000,052 m. To write this number in
scientific notation, the decimal point is moved
11 places to the right. As a result, the diameter
is written as 5.2 x 107’ m. The number of
places moved by the decimal to the right is
expressed as a negative exponent of 10.
Example 1.1
Solve the following:
(a) 5.123x 10^4 m + 3.28x 10^5 m
(b) = 2.57x10^-2 mm — 3.43x 10^-3 mm
Solution
(a) 5.123
x 10^4 m + 3.28x 10^5 m
= 5.123 10^4 m + 32.8x10^4 m
= (5.123+32.8) 10^4 m
= 37.923x10^4 m
= 3.7923
x 10^m
2.57x 10^-2 mm-—3.43 x 10^-3 mm
= 2.57x10^-2 mm-0.343 x10^-3 mm
= (2.57 - 0.343) 10^-2 mm
= 2.227x10^-5 mm
= 2.227x10^-5 m
Example 1.2
Find the value of each of the following
quantities:
(b)
(a) (4x 10? kg) (6x 10°

The smallest measurement that can be taken with a
metre rule is 1 mm. One millimetre is known as least
countof the metre rule.
Least count is the smallest measurement that
can be taken accurately with an instrument.
To measure the length of an object, the metre
tule is placed in such a way that its zero coincides
one edge of the object and then the reading in front
of the other edge is the length of the object. One
common source of error comes from the angle at
which an instrument is read. Metre ruler should
either be tipped on its edge or read when the

person's eye is directly above the ruler as shown in Fig:1,1 at point B. If the metre
tuler is read from an angle, such as from point Aor C, the object will appear to be

Vernier Callipers
It is an instrument used té_measure small
lengths down to 1/10th of a millimetre. It can be used
to measure the thickness, diameter, width or depth
of an object. The two scalés on it are:
(a) Amainscalewhich has marking of 1mm each.
(b) — A Vernier (Sliding) scale of length 9 mm and it
is divided into 10 equal parts.
Least count of a Vernier Callipers is the
difference between one mainscale division (M.S) and
one Vernier scale (V.S) division.
Hence, Least count = 1 M.S div- 1V.S div

1.6 Mass Measuring Instruments
Physical Balance
There are many kinds of balances used
for measuring mass of an object. In our daily
life, we use the term weight instead of mass. In
Physics, they have different meanings. Mass is
the measure of quantity of matter in a body
whereas the weight is the force by which the
body is attracted towards the Earth. Weight
can be measured using spring balance
(Fig. 1.8). The mass of an object is found by
comparing it with known standard \masses.
This process is called weighing. In.laboratories,
we use physical balance shown in Fig. 1.9
which is based on the principle of levers. The
process of measurementis given below:
1. Level base of thesbalance using levelling
screws until the plumb line is exactly above
the pointed. mark.
2. Turn the knob so that the pans of the balance are raised up. Is the beam
horizontal and pointer at the centre of the scale? If not, turn the balancing
screws on the beam so that it becomes horizontal.
Place the object to be weighed on the left pan.
Place the known weight from the weight box in the right pan using forceps.
5. Adjust the weight so that pointer remains on zero or oscillates equally on
both sides of the zero of the scale.
6. The total of standard masses (weights) is a measure of the mass of the object
in the left pan.

It is a cylinder made of glass or transparent plastic
with a scale divided.in cubic centimetres (cm’ or cc) or
millilitres (mL) marked on it. It is used to find the volume
of liquids and hon-dissolvable solids.
The level of liquids in the cylinder is marked to find
the volume. In order to read the volume correctly, the

measurement should indicate the estimated error in the measured values.
Usually, there are three types of experimental errors affecting the
measurements.
() HumanErrors (ii) Systematic Errors (iii) Random Errors
(i) Human Errors
They occur due to personal performance. The limitation of the human
perception such as the inability to perfectly estimate the position of the pointer
ona scale. Personal errors can also arise due to faulty procedure to read the scale.
The correct measurement needs to line up your eye right in front of the level. In
timing experiments, the reaction time of an individual to start or stop clock also
affects the measured value. Human error can be reduced by ensuring proper
training, techniques and procedure to handle the instruments and avoiding
environmental distraction or disturbance for proper focusing:The best way is to
use automated or digital instruments to reduce the impactof human errors.
(ii) Systematic Errors
They refer to an effect that influences all, measurements of particular
measurements equally. It produces a consistencé difference in reading. It occurs
due to some definite rule. It may occur.due to zero error of instrument, poor
calibration of instrument or incorrect marking. The effect of this kind of error can
be reduced by comparing the instrument with another which is known to be
more accurate. Thus, a correction factor can be applied.

oscillations, say 30 oscillations is noted and then
mean or average value of one oscillation is
determined.

1.10 Uncertainty in a Measurement
There is no such thing as a perfect measurement. Whenever a physical
quantity is measured except counting, there is inevitably some uncertainty about
its determined value due to some instrument. enna in Digital
This uncertainty may be due to use of anumber ! ma fo
of reasons. One reason is the type of instrument Some modem measuring
being used. We know that every measuring | instruments havea digital scale.

measure the length of a straight line with the
help of a metre rule calibrated in millimetres. Let the end point/of the line lies
between 10.3 cm and 10.4 cm marks. By convention, if theend of the line does
not touch or cross the midpoint of the smallest division, the'reading is confined
to the previous division. In case the end of the line seems to be touching or have
crossed the midpoint, the reading is extended to the next division. Thus, in this
example, the maximum uncertainty is + 0.05.cm. It is, infact, equivalent to an
uncertainty of 0.1 cm equal to the least count‘of the instrument divided into two
parts, half above and half below the recordéd reading.
The uncertainty in small length“Such as diameter of a wire and short
interval of time can be reduced furtherby taking multiple readings and then
finding average value. For example,\the average time of one oscillation of a
simple pendulum is usually found-by measuring the time for thirty oscillations.
The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured quantity can be
indicated conveniently by using significant figures.
1.11 Significant Figures
We can count the number of candies in a jar and know it exactly by
counting but we cannot measure the height of the jar exactly. All measurements
include uncertainties depending upon the refinement of the instrument which is
used for measurement.
It is important to reflect the degree of uncertainty in a measurement by
recording the observation in significant figures.
The significant figures or digits are the digits of a
measurement which are reliably known.
Figure 1.14 shows a rod whose length is
measured with a ruler. The measurement shows the
length in between 4.6 cm and 4.7 cm. Since the length [| Fig tt4 |
of the rod is slightly more than 4.6 cm but less than 4.7 cm, so the first student
estimates it to be 4.6 cm whereas the second student takes it as 4.7 cm. The first
student thinks that the edge is nearer to 6 mm mark whereas the

second student considers the edge of the rod nearer to 7 mm mark. It is difficult
to decide what is the true length. | Quick Quiz J
Both students agree on digit 4 Name some repetitive processes
but the next digit is doubtful which has occuring in nature which could serve as
been determined by estimation only _ "®2sonabletimestandard.
and has a probability of error. Therefore, it is known as a doubtful digit. In any
Measurement, the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit are
known-as significant figures.
The following points are to be kept in mind while determining the number
of significant figures in any data. All digits from 1 to 9 are significant. However,
zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules apply:
(a) Azero between two digits is considered significant. For example-in 5.06m, the
number of significant figures is 3.
(b) Zeros on the left side of the measured value are not significant. For example,
in 0.0034 m, the number of significant figures is 2.
(c) Zeros on the right side ofa decimal are considered Significant. For example, in
2.40 mm the significant digits are 3.
(d) If numbers are recorded in scientific notation) then all the digits before the
exponent are significant. For example, in 3.50 x 10‘m, the significant figures
are 3.
How many significant figures are < os each ofthe following?
(a) 1.25 10° m (b) 125% (90.125 m (d) 0.000125 km
1.12 Precision and Accuracy
A physical measureménts should be precise as well as accurate. These are
two separate concepts(and need clear distinction. Generally, precision of a
measurement refers to how close together a group of measurements actually are
to each other. Acclfacy of a measurement refers how close the measured value is
to some accepted or true value.
(a) $
(b) 13]
Precise not accurate Accurate not precise Accurate and precise
Fig. 1.15
Aclassic illustration is helpful to distinguish the two concepts. Consider a
target or bullseye hit by arrows in Fig. 1.15. To be precise, arrows must hit near
each other (Fig.1.15-a) and to be accurate, arrows must hit near the bullseye

(Fig. 1.15-b). Consistently hitting near the centre of bullseye indicates both
precision and accuracy (Fig. 1.15-c). When these concepts are applied to
measurements, the precision is determined by the instrument being used for
measurement. The smaller the least count, the more precise is the measurement.
A measurement is accurate if it correctly reflects the size of the object being
measured. Accuracy depends on fractional uncertainty in the measurement.
Infact, it is relative measurement which is important. The smaller the size of
physical quantity, the more precise instrument is needed to be used. The
accuracy of measurement is reflected by the number of significant figures, the
larger is the number of significant figures, the higher is the accuracy.

1.13 Rounding off the Digits
When rounding off numbers to a certain number of significant figures, do
so to the nearest value. If the last digit is more than 5, the retained digit is
increased byone and ifit is less than 5, itis retained as such.
For example:
@) Round offto 2 significant figures: 2.512 x 10? m.
Answer: 2.5 x 107m
(il) Round off
to 3 significant figures: 3.4567 x 10* kg.
Answer: 3.46 x 10*kg
For the integer 5, there is an arbitrary rule:
If the number before the 5 is odd, one is added to the last digit retained.
If the number before the 5 is even, it remains the same:

For example:
() Round off to 2 significant figures: 4.45 x 10° m.
(ii) Round off
to 2 significant figures: 4.55 x 10° m.
Answer: 4.4 x 10° m
Answer: 4.6 x 10° m
Sometimes, logic is applied to decide the fate
of a digit. If we round offto 2 significant figures
An Electronic timer

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects
and the forces that changeit.
Generally, mechanics is divided into two branches:
1. Kinematics 2. Dynamics
Kinematics is the study of motion of objects without referring to forces.
On the other hand, dynamics deals with forces and their effect on the motion of
objects.
In our everyday life, we observe many objects in motion. For example,
cars, buses, bicycles, motorcycles moving on the roads, aeroplanes flying
through air, water flowing in canals or some object falling from the table to the
ground.
The motion of these objects can be studied with or without considering the force
which causes motion in them or changes it.
2.1 Scalars and Vectors
Before we study kinematics in detail, we should-know about the nature of
various physical quantities. Some quantities are called scalars and the others
vectors.
Ascalaris that eysicay which can be
described completély its magnitude only.
Magnitude includes a number and an appropriate unit. When we ask a
shopkeeper to give us 5 kilograms of sugar, he can fully understand how much
quantity we want. It is the magnitude of mass of sugar. Mass is a scalar quantity.
Some other examples\of scalar quantities are distance, length, time, speed,
energy and temperature. Scalar quantities can be added up like numbers.
Forexample; 5 metres + 3 metres = 8 metres.
On the otherhand,
A vector is that physical quantity which needs
magnitude as well as direction to describe it completely.
The examples of vector quantities are displacement, velocity,
acceleration, weight, force, etc. The velocity of a car moving at 90 kilometre per
hour (25 ms“) towards north can be represented by a vector. Velocity is a vector
quantity because it has magnitude 25 ms‘ and direction (towards north).
Vectors cannot be added like scalars. There are specific methods to add up
vectors. These methods take their directions also into consideration.

Representation of vectors
In the textbooks, symbol used fora vector is a bold face letter such as A, v,
F and d etc. Since we cannot write in bold face script on paper, so a vector is
written as the letter with a small arrow over it, ie. A, v, F, d. The magnitude of a
vector is given by italic letter without arrow head. A vector can be represented
graphically by drawing a straight line with an arrow head at one end. The length
of line represents the magnitude of the vector quantity according to a suitable
scale while the direction of arrow indicates the direction of the vector.
To represent the direction, two mutually perpendicular N
lines are required. We can draw one line to represent
east-west direction and the other line to represent
north-south direction as shown in Fig.2.1(a). They,
direction of a vector can be given with respect to these
lines. Mostly, we use any two lines which are
perpendicular to each other. Horizontal line (x x is
called x-axis and vertical line (y y) is called-y-axis,
vector v making an angle@
(Fig. 2.1-b). The point where these axes meetisknown towards north from east
as origin. The origin is usually denoted by ©. These axes Fig 2.1 (a)
are also called reference axes. 4 E
A vector is drawn starting from the origin of
the reference axes towards the given direction. The ~ o x
direction is usually given by afyangle @ (theta) with
x-axis. The angle with x-axisis always measured from
the right side of x-axis inthe-anti-clockwise direction.

Fig. 2.3
Resultant Vector
We can add two or more vectors to get_a single vector. This is called as
resultant vector. It has the same effect as the combined effect of all the vectors to
be added. We have to determine both magnitude and direction of the resultant
vector, therefore, it is quite different from, that of scalar addition. One method of
addition of vectors is the graphical method.
Addition of Vectors by Graphical Method
Let us add two vectors v, and v, having
magnitudes of 300 N and.400 N acting at angles (§
of 30° and 60° with x-axis: By selecting a suitable
scale 100 N = 1cm, We can draw the vectors as
60° a
shown
in Fig. 2.4.(a). x 7) 30°
To add\these vectors, we apply a rule
called head-to-tail rule, which states that:
y Fig. 2.4 (a)
To add a number of vectors, redraw their representative lines
such that the head of one line coincides with the tail of the other.
The resultant vector is given by a single vector which is directed
from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.

Measured length of resultant vector is 6.8 cm
(Fig.2.4-b). According to selected scale,
magnitude of the resultant vectorv is 680 N and
direction is angle
49° with x-axis.
We can find the resultant vector of more than
two vectors by adding them with the same way
applying head-to-tail rule.

Rest and Motion } Fig. 2.4 (b)
When we look around us, we see many things like buildings,trees, electric
poles, etc. which do not change their positions. We say that they-are in a state of
= +
rest. ae Ate ©
If a body does not chan je its position with
respect to its surroundings, itis said to be at rest.
Suppose a motorcyclist'is standing on the road (Fig. 2.5-a). An observer
sees that he is not changinghis position with respect to his surroundings i.e, a
nearby building, tree ora pole. He will say that the motorcyclist is at rest.
Now let us sée what does motion mean? When the motorcyclist is driving
(Fig. 2.5-b), the observer will notice that he is continuously changing his position
with respect'tathe surroundings. Then the observer will say that the motorcyclist
is inmotion.
If a body continuously changes its position with
respect to its surroundings,it is said to be in motion.
The state of rest or motion of a body is always
relative. For example, a person standing in the :
compartment of a moving train is at rest with Fig.
2.5 (b)
respect to the other passengers in the compartment but he is in motion with
respect to an observer standing on the platform ofa railway station.

2.3 Types of Motion
We observe different types of motion in our daily life. A train moves almost
along a straight line, the blades of a fan rotate about an axis, a swing vibrates
about its mean position. Generally, there are three types of motion of bodies.
1. Translatory motion 2. Rotatory motion 3. Vibratory motion
1. Translatory Motic
If the motion of a body is such that every
Particle of the body moves uniformly in
the same direction, it is called tanslatory
motion. For example, the motion of a
train or a car is tanslatory motion (Fig.2.6).
Translatory motion can be of three types:
Fig. 2.6 The motion ofa train Is translatory motion
()_ Linear Motion
If the body moves along a straight line, it is
called linear motion. A freely falling body.is.
the example of linear motion.
(ii) Random Motion (a) Irregular path (b) The motion
of bee
If the body moves along an irregular path | Fig. 2.7 is random motion
(Fig. 2.7), the motion is called random motion.
(iii) Circular Motion
The motion of a body along a circle is called circular
motion. If a ball tied togoné end of a string is whirled, it
moves along a circle, A\Férris wheelis also an example of ‘
circular motion (Fig.2:8). Circular Motion
ne Fig. 2.8
If each point.of a body moves around a fixed point (axis),
the motion of this body is called rotatory motion. For
example, the motion of an electric fan and the drum of a
washing machine dryer is rotatory motion (Fig.2.9). The
motion ofa top is also rotatory motion.
Rotatory motion of a fan
3. Vibratory Motion —
When a body repeats its to and fro motion about a fixed
position, the motion is called vibratory motion. The motion
of aswing ina children parkis vipratory motion (Fig. 2.10).

2.4 Distance and Displacement
We know that motion is the action of an object going from one place to
another or change of position. The length between the original and final
positions may be measured in two ways as either distance or displacement.
The distance is the length of actual path of the motion.
Let a person be travelling from Lahore to Multan in a car. On reaching
Multan, he reads the speedometer and notices that he has travelled a distance of
320 km. It is the distance travelled by that person. Obviously, it is not the shortest
distance from Lahore to Multan, as the car took many turns in the way. He did not
travel along a straight line.
The displacement of an object is a vector quantity whose magnitude is
the shortest distance between the initial and final positi fthe motion
and its direction is from the initial position tog final position.
We can also call this as the change in position.
Note that displacement is a vector quantity
whereas distance is a scalar quantity. Following
example will explain the difference between
distance and displacement. A
Suppose a car travels from a position.A to B. The curved ithe i the actual path
followed bythe car (Fig. 2.11). The total distance covered by the car will be equal
to the length of the curved line‘AB. The displacement d is the straight line AB
directed from A to B as indicated by the arrow head. The SI unit for the
displacement is the same as that of distance.

this purpose, we have to find the

The speed is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of speed isms“ orkmh".
It is obvious that speed of a vehicle does not remain constant throughout the
journey. If the reading of the speedometer of the vehicle is observed, it is always
changing. The speed of a vehicle that is shown by its speedometer at any instant
is called instantaneous speed. Practically we make use of the average speed. It
is defined as:
Average speed = Total distance covered vo0

Velocity
The speed of an-objéct does not tell anything about the direction of
motion. To take into account the direction, the vector concept is needed. For this,
we have to find the displacementd between the initial and final positions.
The fet displacement of a body in unit time is called velocity.
If a body moves from point A to B along a curved path as shown in Fig.2.11, the
displacement dis the straight line AB, then

orkm h*. Consider the example of a car moving towards north at the rate of
70 kmh‘.To differentiate between speed and velocity, we shall say that the speed

of car is 70 km h" which is a scalar quantity. The
velocity of the car is a vector quantity whose
magnitude is 70 kmh” andis directed towards north.

The velocity is said to be uniform if the speed and

with uniform velocity is the downward motion of a
paratrooper. When a paratrooper jumps from an aeroplane, he falls freely for a
few moments. Then the parachute opens. At this stagé:the force of gravity acting
downwards on the paratrooper is balanced by the resistance of air on the
parachute that acts upward. Consequently, the: paratrooper moves down with
uniform velocity.
2.6 Acceleration
Whenever the velocity of an object’is increasing, we
say that the object is accelerating»For example, when
a car overtakes another one, it accelerates to a greater
velocity (Fig.2.12). In contrary to that the velocity
decreases when brakes‘are applied to slow down a
bicycle ora car. In.both the cases, a change in velocity
While overtaking, a car

occurs. Fig. 2.12
Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity.
The change in velocity can occur in magnitude or direction or both of them. The
acceleration is positive if the velocity is increasing and it is negative if the velocity
is decreasing. Negative acceleration is also called deceleration or retardation.
Acceleration is a vector quantity like velocity, but the direction of acceleration is
that of change of velocity. If a body is moving with an initial velocity v, and after
some time t its velocity changes to v,, the change in velocity is Av = v, - v, that
occurs in time t. In this case, rate of change of velocity i.e., acceleration will be
average acceleration.

2.7 Graphical Analysis of Motion
A graph is a pictorial diagram in the
form of a straight line or a curve which shows
the relationship between two physical
quantities. Usually, we draw a graph on a
paper on which equally spaced horizontal and
vertical lines are drawn. Generally, every 10"
line is a thick line on the graph paper. In order
to draw a graph, two mutually perpendicular
thick lines xox and yoy are selected as x and y
axes as shown in Fig 2.13. The point where the
two axes intersect each other is known as origin O. Positive values along x-axis
are taken to the right side of the origin and negative Values are taken to the left
side. Similarly, positive values along y-axis are‘taken above the origin whereas
negative values are taken below the origin-Normally, the independent quantity
eT
Fig. 2.13
is taken along x-axis and dependent variable‘quantity along y-axis. For example,
in distance-time graph, t is independent and S is dependent variable. Therefore,
tshould be along x-axis and S along y-axis.
To represent a physical quantity along any axis, a suitable scale is chosen
by considering the minimurmand maximum values of the quantity.
Distance-Time Graph
Distance-time.graph shows the relation between distance S and time t taken by a
moving body:
Leta car be moving ina straight line on a motorway. Suppose that we measure its
distance from starting point after every one minute, and record it in the table
given below:
ain 0 1 2 3 4 5
ose. 0 12 24 36 48 60

Follow the steps given below to draw a graph on a centimetre graph paper:
(i) Take time talong x-axis and distance
S along y-axis.
(ii) Select suitable scales (1 minute = 1 cm) along x-axis and (1.2 km =1 cm)
along y-axis, The graph paper shown here is not to the scale.
(iii), Mark the values of each big division along x
and y axes according to the scale.
(iv) Plotall pairs of values of time and distance by _
marking points on the graph paper.
(v) Join all the plotted points to obtain a best m3
straight line as shownin Fig. 2.14. From the Te
table, we can observe that car has covered =,
equal distance in equal intervals of time. This
shows that the car moves with uniform
speed. Therefore, a straight line graph

Now consider another journey of the car as recorded in the table given below:

Table shows that speed goes on‘inereasing in equal intervals of time. This is very
obvious from the graph as shown in Fig. 2.15. The graph line is curved upward.
This is the case when the body (car) is moving with certain acceleration.

The graph line is curved downwards. This shows that distance travelled in the

of motion with deceleration or negative acceleration as shown in Fig.2.16.

2.9 Speed-Time Graph
Suppose we can note the speed of the same car after every one second
and record it in the table given below, we can draw the graph between speed v
versus time t. This is called speed-time graph.
Table

Take t along x-axis and v along y-axis. Scale can be selected as 1s = 1 cm (x-axis)
and speed 10 ms~ = 1 cmalongy-axis.
Shape of the graph is shown in Fig. 2.19: It is a straight line rising upward. This
shows that speed increases by the same amount after every one second. Thisis a
motion with uniform acceleration. It is also evident from the table.

This shows that when a car moves withconstant acceleration, the velocity-time
graph is a straight line which rises through same height for equal intervals of time.

2.11 Area Under Speed-Time Graph
The distance moved by an object can also be determined by using its
speed-time graph. For example, figure 2.23 shows that the object is moving
with constant speed v. Fora time-interval t, the distance covered by the object

Only the magnitudes of vector quantities are used.
Acceleration is assumed to be uniform.
The direction of initial velocity is taken as positive. Other quantities which
are in the direction of initial velocity
are taken as positive. The quantities in
the direction opposite to the initial velocity are taken as negative.
2.13 Free Fall Acceleration
When a body is falling freely under the action of gravity of the Earth, the
acceleration acting on itis the gravitational acceleration and is denoted by g. The
direction of gravitational acceleration is always downwards. Its value is 9.8 ms*,
but for convenience we shall use the value of gas 10 ms”.
For Your Information! Since the freely falling) bodies move vertically
downwards in aystraight line with uniform
J -~—_ acceleration g, so. the three equations of
motion can,be applied to the motion of such
J -—a=-= bodies. While applying equations of motion,
the acceleration a is replaced by g. Thus,

canbe written as:

It should be remembered that while using these
equations, the following points should be kept in mind:

(iii)
2gS=ve—ve oo -------------
If a body.is’released from some height to fall
freely, its initial velocity v, will be taken as zero.
The gravitational acceleration g will be taken as
positive in the downward direction. All other
quantities will also be taken as positive in the
downward direction. The quantities in the
direction opposite to the acceleration will be
taken as negative.
If a body is thrown vertically upward, the value
of g will be negative and the final velocity will be
zero at the highest point.

Example 2.5
An iron bob is dropped from the top of a tower. It reaches the ground in 4
seconds. Find: (a) the height of the tower (b) the velocity of the ball as it strikes

An arrow is thrown vertically upward with the help of a bow. The velocity of the
arrow when it leaves the bow is 30 ms“. Determine time to reach the highest
point? Also, find the maximum height attained by the arrow.

Relativity
In 1905, famous scientist Albert Einstein proposed his revolutionary
theory of special relativity which modified many of the basic concepts of physics.
According to this theory, speed of light is a universal constant. Its value is
approximately 3 x10° ms‘. Speed of light remains the same forall motions. Any
object with mass cannot achieve speeds equal to or greater ‘than that of light.
This is known as universal speed limit.

In kinematics, we studied the motion of objects. If the position, velocity
and acceleration were known at any time, then the position and velocity of the
moving body at another time could be completely described. But one of the
things left out of this discussion was the cause of acceleration produced in the
body. If a stone is dropped from a height, it is accelerated downward. It is
because the Earth exerts a force of gravity on the stone that pulls it down. When
we drive a car or motorcycle, the engine exerts a force which produces
acceleration. We will observe that whenever there is acceleration, there is always
a force present to cause that acceleration. Dynamics is concerned with the forces
that produce change in the motions of bodies.
3.1 Concept of Force
A common concept of a force is a push or a
pull that starts, stops or changes the magnitude and
direction of velocity ofabody. We come across many =
forces in our daily life. Some of them we apply on
other bodies and some are acting on us./For
example, when we open a door, we push or-pull it by
applying force. When we are sitting in a,car,.we push
against the seat as the car turns rounda corner.
=
em
Fig. 3.1
Force transfers energy to an object. Take the example of a man who moves
a wheelbarrow with its load. The;man first applies force to lift it and then applies
force to push it (Fig.3.1). Hecapplies a different amount of force on each handle
when turning the wheelbarrow around the corner in order to keep it from tipping
over. The examples of forces acting on us are the force of gravity acting downward,
the force of friction'which helps us to walk on the ground and many others.
Types
of Forces
There are two major types of forces:
1, Contact Forces 2. Non-contact Forces
A contact force is a force that is exerted by one object on the other at the
point of contact. Applied forces (push a pull and twist) are contact forces. Some
other examples of contact forces are the following:
(i) Friction
It is the force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes in
contact with the surface of another.
EE | EEE

(ii) Drag
The drag force is the resistant force caused by the motion of a body
through a fluid. It acts opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with
respect to surrounding fluid.
ii) Thrust
It is an upward force exerted by a liquid on an object immersed in it. When
we try to immerse an object in water, we feel an upward force exerted on the
object. This force increases as we push the object deeper into the water. A ship
can float in the sea due to this force which balances the weight of the ship.
(iv) Normal Force
It is the force of reaction exerted by the surface on an object lying on it.
This force acts outward and perpendicular to the surface. It is also called the
support force upon the object.
(v) Air Resistance
Itis the resistance (opposition) offered by air when an object falls through it.
(vi) Tension Force
It is the force experienced by a rope when a personof load pulls it.
(vii) Elastic Force
It is a force that brings certain materials back to their original shape after
being deformed. Examples are rubber bands, springs, trampoline, etc.
: mn-contact Forces
Anon-contact force is defined asthe force between two objects which are
not in physical contact. The non-contact forces can work from a distance. That is
why, these are sometimes called as‘action-at-a-distance. There is always a field
linked with a non-contact force. Due to this property, non-contact forces are also
called field forces. A few examples of non-contact forces are described below:
() Gravitational Force
An apple falling<down from a tree is one of the best examples of
gravitational force (Fig. 3.2). When we throw an object upward, it is the
gravitational force of the Earth that brings it back to the
Earth. In fact, the.gravitational force is an attractive force
that exists among all bodies which have mass. It is a
long-range force given by Newton's law of gravitation:
mm.
F=G—+= where m, and m, are two
masses distant rapartand Gis constant of gravitation. Its value |
is 6.67 x 10" Nm’ kg”. The Sun's gravitational force keeps the &
Earth and all other planets of our solar system in fixed orbits. Fig, 3.2
Similarly, the gravitational force of the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. It also
keeps the atmosphere and oceans fixed to the surface of the Earth. Even an
object resting on a surface exerts a downward force called its weight due to
attractive force of the Earth also known as gravity.

(ii) Electrostatic Force
An electrostatic force acts between two charged
objects. The opposite charges attract each other and
similar charges repel each other as shown in Fig. 3.3. oe
Like gravitational force, electrostatic force is also a
long-range force.
(iii) Magnetic Force R
It is a force which a magnet exerts on other
magnets and magnetic materials like iron, nickel and
cobalt. You might have observed that iron pins
attracted in the presence of a magnet without any
physical contact (Fig. 3.4). Magnetic force between the
poles of two magnets can be either attractive or
repulsive. This can be observed very easily by bringing2
different poles of two magnets close to each othervLike
poles repel and unlike poles attract each other. Fig. 3.4
(iv) Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces
These are also non-contact forces acting between the subatomic
particles. We will study these forces inthé.next section.
3.2 Fundamental Forces J
There are four fundamental forces.in nature. These are:
1. Gravitational force 2 Electromagnetic force
3. Strong nuclear force 4. Weak nuclear force
Every force comes under any of these forces.
Gravitational Fi
The gravitational force has been discussed in the previous section. We
often talk about this force. It is the weakest one among all four forces. Being a
long range force, it extends to infinite distance although it becomes weaker and
weaker. -
Electromagnetic Force
It is the force that causes the interaction
between electrically charged particles. Electrostatic
and magnetic forces come under this category. These
are long-range forces, The areas in which these forces
act are called electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic Fig.
forces are stronger than gravitational and weak orchmoving magnet

nuclear forces. This force causes all chemical reactions. It binds together atoms,
molecules and crystals etc. At macroscopic level, it is a possible cause of friction
between different surfaces in relative motion.
Strong Nuclear Force
It holds the atomic nuclei together by binding the
protons and neutrons in the nucleus over coming
repulsive electromagnetic force between positively
charged protons. It is also a short-range force with
the order of 10°*m. If the distance between
nucleons increases beyond this range, this force
ceases to act. Fig. 3.6
‘The binding force of
= protonsand neutrons
Weak Nuclear Force in the nucleus
Weak nuclear force is responsible for the
disintegration of a nucleus. For example, the
weak nuclear force executes the B-decay {beta
decay) of a neutron, in which a neutron
transforms into a proton (Fig.3.7). In the process,
a B-particle (electron) and an uncharged particle
called antineutrino are emitted.[mother words,
we can say that due to weak nuclear force
radioactive decay of atoms’ occurs. However,
weak nuclear force is stronger than the gravitational force but weaker than the
electromagnetic force. It is a short-range force of the order 10” m.
Unification:of Weak Nuclear and Electromagnetic Forces
A Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdus Salam along with Sheldon Glashow and
Steven Weinberg were awarded in 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their
contributions to the unification of the weak nuclear force and electromagnetic
force as electroweak force. Although these two forces appear to be different in
everyday phenomena, but the theory models them as two different aspects of
the same force. Its effects are observed for the interactions taking place at very
high energy.

3.4 Newton's Laws of Motion
Newton's First(Law of Motion
Weight
Do You Know?
Sir Isaac Newton was born
It is our-common observation that a force in Lincolnshire on January
is required to-move or to stop a body. A book 4, 1643, The name of his
placed on a table remains there unless a force is famous book is “Principia
Mathematica”.
applied to move it (Fig.3.9). A ball rolling on floor
should continue to move with the same velocity
in the absence of an applied force. But practically,
we see that it is not true. The ball stops after
covering some distance. In fact, an opposing
force (friction) causes the ball to stop. Newton
expressed such observations in his first law of
motion which states that:

Abody continues its state of rest
or of uniform motion ina
straight line unless acted upon by some external force.
When a fast-moving bus stops suddenly, the passengers tend to bend forward. It
is because they want to continue their motion. On the other hand, when the bus
starts moving quickly from rest, the passengers are pushed back against the seat.
This time, the tendency of passengers is to retain their state of rest.
According to first law of motion, a bus moving on the road should
continue its motion without any force exerted by the engine. But practically, we
see that if the engine stops working, the bus comes to rest after covering some
distance. Itis because of the friction between the tyres of the bus and the road. All
the bodies moving on the Earth are stopped by the force of friction: If you were in
outer space and throw an object away where no force is acted‘upon it, the object
would continue to move forever with constant velocity.
The first law of motion also provides us anotherdefinition of force which is
stated as follows:
“the siateraF esters0
In simple words, we can say thatforce causes acceleration.
Property of Inertia
A net force is required to‘change the velocity of
objects. For instance, a’net force may cause a
bicycle to pick up speed quickly. But when the same
force is applied toa truck, any change in the motion
may not be dbsefved. We say that the truck has
more inertia than a bicycle. The mass of an object is
a measure of its inertia. The greater the mass of an
object, the greater is its inertia. =
The propertyof body to maintain its state of rest or -
of uniform motion ina straight line is called inertia. |
As a result of the role of inertia in Newton's
first law, this law is sometimes called as law of | When the table cloth is pulled
inertia. abruptly, the objects remain in
their original position on the
eal table.

Newton's Second Law of Motion
Newton's first law indicates that if no net force acts on an object, then the
velocity of the object remains unchanged. The second law deals with the
acceleration produced in a body whena net force acts upon it. Newton's second
law can be stated as:
If a net force of magnitude F acts on a body of mass m and produces an
acceleration of magnitude a, then the second law can be written mathematically
as:
and qa F

So a wo

or aq = (cénstant)

According to SI units, if m=1kg, ‘a= 1ms* F=1N, then the value of the
constant will be 1. Therefore, the above equation can be written as:
a= xt
m
or’ F=ma wailed)
First lawof motion provides the definition of force, i.e., a force produces
an acceleration in a body. By the second law of motion (F = ma), we can calculate
mathematically, the amount of force required to produce a certain amount of
acceleration in a body of known mass. The SI unit of force is newton (N).
From Eq 3.1
EE | EEE

Effect
of Force on Velocity
Newton's second law also tells that a force can change the velocity of a
body by producing acceleration or deceleration in it. As velocity is a vector
quantity, so the change may be inits magnitude, direction or in both of them.
Newton’s Third Law of Motion
Whenever there is an interaction between two
bodies A and B, such that the body A exerts a force on
body B, the force is known as action of A on B. In
response to this action, the body B exerts a force on
the body A. This force is known as reaction of B on A.
For example, when we press a spring, the force exerted
by our hand on the spring is action. Our hand also
experiences a force exerted by the spring. This isthe
force of reaction (Fig.3.10). Newton expressed these
action and reaction forces in his third law of motion. It
is stated as:
Fig. 3.10

Forces Act in Pairs
We have studied that forces act in pairs when two objects interact, ie.,
action and reaction forces. We often notice a force that seems to make
something happen but usually we do not notice the other force involved. Here
are some examples of pairs of forces involved in accordance with Newton's third
law of motion.
EEE EEE

(i) Considera block lying on a table as shownin Fig. 3.11.
The force acting downward on the block is the weight. The block exerts a
downward force on the table equal to its weight w. The table also exerts a
reaction force F, on the block. The two forces on the block balance each other
and the block remains at rest.

(i) When a bullet is fired from a gun, the bullet moves jin. the forward direction
with a force F. This is the force of action. The gun recoils;in

3.5 Limitations of Newton’s Laws of Motion
We have already explained that Newton's laws of motion can be applied
with very high degree of accuracy tothe‘motion of objects and velocities which
we come across in everyday life.
The problems arise when we deal with the motion of elementary particles
having velocities close to thatroflight. For that purpose, relativistic mechanics
developed by Albert Einstein is applicable.
After all this discussion, we can say that Newton's laws of motion are not
exact for all types of motion, but provide a good approximation, unless an object
is small enough ormeving close to the speed of light.
Look at the photographs below. Identify the pairs of forces acting in each
photograph.

3.6 Mass and Weight
Commonly, we consider mass and weight as the same quantities but
scientifically, mass and weight are two different quantities. When we say that the
weight of this object is 5 kg, itis not true. In fact, 5 kg is the mass of the object. The
simplest definition of mass is that it is a measure of the quantity of matter in a
body. Scientifically, mass of a body can be defined as:
‘accelerati
~
Mass is ascalar quantity. It remains the same everywhere; Practically, mass
is measured by an ordinary balance. The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).
Weight is a gravitational force acting on the object. It is a vector quantity
directed downward, towards the centre of the Earth.
The weight of an object is equal to the force with
which the Earth attracts t! body towards its centre.
Gravitational Field
The gravitational fieldjis a space around a mass in which another mass
experiences a force dué)to gravitational attraction. The gravitational field
strength is defined,as the gravitational force acting on unit mass. Thus, mass m
on the surface ofthe Earth exerts a force known as its weightw given byw = mg,
where g is the gravitational field strength. Its value is 10 N kg".
As the value of g varies from place to place and also with altitude,
therefore, the value of weight does not remain the same everywhere.
It varies from place to place according to variation in g. Though an
object's weight may vary from one place to another, but at any particular
location, its weight is proportional to its mass. Thus, we can conveniently
compare the masses of two objects at a given location by comparing their
weights. The weight cannot be measured by an ordinary balance. A spring
balance can be used to measure the weight. The
SI unit of weight is newton (N).

3.7 Mechanical and Electronic Balances
Balance scales are commonly used to compare masses of objects or to
weigh objects by balancing them with standard weights.
Mechanical Balances
A mechanical balance consists of a
rigid horizontal beam that oscillates on a
central knife edge as a fulcrum. It has two
end knife edges equidistant from the centre.
Two pans are hung from bearings on the end
knife edges (Fig.3.16). The material to be
weighed is put in one pan. Standard weights
are put on the other pan, The deflection of
the balance may be indicated by a pointer
attaches to the beam. The weights on the
Pan are adjusted to bring the beam in
equilibrium.
There is another type of mechanical
balances which are used to weigh heavy
items like flour bags, cement bags, steel
bars, etc. These are called mechanical
platform balances (Fig.3.17). Standard
weights are not required to use this balance.
Its reason is that the fulcrum of the beam of
such a balance is kept very-near to its one
end. Therefore, much smaller weights have
to be put at the other end of beam to bring it
to equilibrium. These smaller weights have
already been_calibrated to the standard
weights.
Electronic Balances
No standard weights are required to
use in an electronic balance (Fig.3.18). Only
it has to be connected to a power supply.
There are some models which can operate
by using dry cell batteries. An electronic
balance is more precise than mechanical
balance. When an object is placed on it, its
mass is displayed on its screen. Now-a-days,
al Fig. 3.18

electronic balances also display the total price of the material if the rate per kg is
fed to the balance.
A force meter is a scientific instrument that measures
force. It is also called as a newton meter or a spring balance
(Fig.3.19). Now-a-days digital force meters are also available.
You have already learnt about mechanical and electronic
balances. They measure mass of the objects in kilograms or its
multiples. On the other hand, force meter measures force
directly in newtons (N).
An ordinary force meter has a spring inside it. Upper
end of the spring is attached to a handle. A hook is attached to
the lower end the spring that holds the object. A pointeris also
attached to the spring at its upper end. A scale in newtons is }
provided along the spring such that the pointer coincides with |
zero of the scale when nothing is hung withthe hook.
The object to be weighed is hung.
with the hook. The mass of the object
causes the spring to compress, The
pointer indicates the weight) of the
object. However, some forcé-meters are
also based on the stretching of the
spring when a load/s hung. In this case,
the pointer is.attached at the lower end
of the spring:
In some spring balances, the
scale measures the mass which can be
readily converted into newtons by
multiplying the mass in kg with the value
of g =10ms”.
A digital force meter measures
directly the weight of the object in
newtons (Fig. 3.20).

When a cricket ball is hit by the bat, it moves on the ground with a
reasonably large velocity. According to Newton's first law of motion, it should
continue to move with constant velocity. But, practically, we observe that it
eventually stops after covering some distance. Does any force act on the ball in
opposite direction that stops the ball? Yes, it is the force of friction between the
ball and the ground that opposes the motion ofthe ball.
Dissipative Effect of Friction —
Friction is a dissipative force due to which the energy is wasted in doing
work to overcome against friction. The lost energy appears in the form of heat.
A very common example of energy dissipation is
the rubbing of hands (Fig.3.21). When we rub our hands,
heat is produced due to friction and our hands become
warm. Similarly, the temperature of machines rises due
to friction between its moving parts that can cause many
problems. The tyres of vehicles also wear, out after
becoming too hot due to friction between tyres and
road.
Fig. 3.21 Rubbing hands
Shooting of stars seen in the sky at night also happen due to friction ofair.
These are actually asteroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere. As they are
moving, air resistance causes.géneration of heat. Their temperature becomes so
high that they start burningand ultimately disintegrate.
SN Do You Know?
On a-wet road, the water does not form
wet layer-between the tyre surface and the road
surface due to the spaces in the tread pattern on
the tyre. This reduces the chances of skidding of
vechicles on wet roads.
Sliding Friction
The friction between two solid surfaces is called sliding friction which can
be divided into two categories.
1. Static friction 2. Kinetic friction

Static Friction F,
Let us consider the motion of a block F t
on a horizontal surface. The arrangement is
shown in Fig. 3.22. When a weight is put in
the pan, a force F = T equal to the sumof this
weight and weight of the pan acts on the
block. This force tends to pull the block. At Fig. 3.22
the same time an opposing force appears
that does not let the block move. This Some frogs can cling
opposing force is the static friction F,. to a vertical surface,
. — such as this leaf,
Kinetic Friction eau ofthe aaa
If we go on adding more weights in friction betw
the pan one by one in small steps, astage will their feet xO
come when the block starts sliding on the surface. a
horizontal surface. This is the limit of static friction that is equal to the total
weights including pan. When the blockis sliding, friction still exists. Itis known as
kinetic friction.
Do You.Know?
Whena shuttle re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere, the friction caused by the
atmosphere raises the surface temperature of the shuttle to aver 950°C.
mg
Terminal Velocity
When an object falls fréely, it is accelerated by an amount g = 10 ms~. But
practically the acceleration.may be different. Air resistance plays an important
role in determining howsfast an object accelerates when it falls.
If we drop acricket ball and a piece of Styrofoam of the same weight from
a certain height, they will hit the ground at the same time only if there were no air
resistance. Both would fall with the same acceleration
g = 10ms°. Practically, the ball in air, would drop faster.
The Styrofoam having larger surface would face greater
opposing force of the air and thus moves slowly.
Experiments have been made in this respect and
it was found that the faster an object falls the more air
resistance will be exerted on it. A speed is finally attained
at which the upward force of air resistance balances the
downward force of gravity. When this happens, the fig. 3.23
object stops accelerating. It keeps falling at a constant 4 paratrooper falling with
a terminal velocity

velocity. This constant velocity achieved by an object is called its terminal
velocity. Even a heavy object like a meteorite does not gain an infinite velocity as
it falls to the Earth.
This principle applies to paratroopers. Air resistance acting against the
large surface area of a parachute allows for descent at a safer velocity (Fig.3.23).
Friction in human joints is very low because

Fluid
Rolling Friction
The static and kinetic friction which we have studied so far is the sliding
friction. There is another type of friction which is called rolling friction. When an
object rolls over a surface, the friction produced is‘called rolling friction. The idea
of rolling friction is
associated with the Practically, thescontact point is [V7
concept of wheel. In our not he ircular; it becomes

Ball bearings also playthésame role as is played by the wheels. Many machines
in industry are designed with ball bearings so that the moving parts roll on the
ball bearing and/friction is greatly reduced. The rolling friction is about one
hundred timessmaller than the sliding friction.
The reason forthe [2RCMaMrinnrn)
rolling friction to be less, hovercraft isa kind of ship

underneath by powerful
fans forming a cushion of

offers very small resistance.

Methods to Reduce Friction
The following methods are used to reduce friction:
(i) The parts which slide against each other are highly polished.
(ii) Since, the friction of liquids is less than that of solid
surfaces, therefore, oil or grease is applied between
the moving parts of the machinery. oe
(iii) As rolling friction is much less than the sliding ——
friction, so sliding friction is converted into rolling Fig. 3.24
friction by the use of ball bearings (Fig. 3.24) in the machines and wheels

bodies moving through air or water are
streamlined to minimize air or water

smoothly over the slanting surface of a speedy car
vehicle. This type of flow of air is known as streamline flow. A streamline
flow over the car is shown.in Fig. 3.25. The vehicles designed pointed from
the front are said to be streamlined.
3.9 Momentum and Impulse
Suppose that-a bicycle rider and a heavy truck are moving with the same
speed, which onétan be stopped easily, depends on the quantity of motion of
the moving-body. It is our common observation that quantity of motion in a
moving body depends on its mass and velocity. Greater is the mass, the greater
will be the quantity of motion. Similarly, greater is the velocity, the greater will be
quantity of motion. This quantity of motion is called momentum and denoted by
p.ltis defined as:
The momentum of a moving body is the product of its mass and velocity.
Therefore, p=mxv... . (3.2)
Like velocity momentum is also a vector quantity. The SI unit momentum is
(kg ms”). Itcan also be written as (N s).

When a ball is hit by a bat, the force is exerted on the ball for a very short
interval of time. In such cases, it is very difficult to calculate the exact magnitude
of the force. However, initial velocity v, of the ball and final velocity v, after
collision can be found easily.
During atime interval A ¢, the average acceleration ais given by
Av _V,-V;

According to Newton's second law of motion, the value of average force
acting during the interval A twill be:
or
Equation (3.4) shows that F and A t cannot be-exactly known but their
product which is equal to the change of momentum (mv, — mv) can be
calculated. For such cases, the product F x A tis called as Impulse of the force.
When a large force F acts on an object fot a short interval of time, the impulse
of the force is defined as the total change in momentum of the object.
Dividing both sides of Eq.3.4 by At, we have
m(Av)
cont
where m(Av) is the change in momentum Ap. Equation (3.5) gives the value of
force in terms of momentum i.e., force acting on an object is equal to the change
in momentum ofthe object per unit time.

Fi (3.6)
Equation (3.6) suggests to define Newton's second law of motion in terms of
momentumi.e.,
The rate of change of momentum of a
body is equal to the force acting on it.
The direction of change in momentum is that of the force.

Packing of Fragile Objects
Fragile objects such as glassware may break easily due to
jerks or by the direct impact with hard objects during
their transportation.
To protect them soft, packing materials are used for
these objects. These materials reduce the effect of quick’
changein momentum. Consequently, the force actingori the fragile objects
is greatly reduced. Special materials like Styrof pg the frs cardboard
sheets, bubble wrap are used for the packing of suc objects.
Crumple Zones
[Air
bag |
A crumple zone of an
automobile is a structural
feature designed to compress
during an accident to absorb
deformation energy fromthe
impact. Typically, crumple
zones are located in-front and
behind of the main body of
the vehicle.
Crumple zones work by managing crash energy absorbing within the outer
parts of the vehicle, rather than being directly transmitted to the occupants.
This is achieved by controlled weakling of outer parts (plastic bumpers, etc.)
of the vehicle, while strengthening of the passenger cabin.

3.10 Principle of Conservation of Momentum
The collection of objects is known as a ‘system’, If no a
external forcetacts on any object of the system, it is @ @
known as isolated system. Consider a system of two TM ma
balls of masses m; and mz. Suppose that the balls
are moving with velocities v,and v, along a straight
line in the same direction. If v, > v, , the balls will ve
collide as shown in Fig. 3.26. If their velocities ar’
becomev, ,and¥z respectively after collision, then @ @
Total momentum of the system before collision = mi¥,+ m2 — Fig. 3.26

Total momentum of the system after collision = mv, + move
The principle of conservation of momentum states that:
EE | EEE

If no external forc e acts on an isolated
system, the final total momentum
_of the system is equal to the initial total momentum of the syste!
This means that:
Total momentum of the _ Total momentum of the
system before collision system after collision
Or m4, + M2 = mM, + MM
To explain this principle, let us consider the collision of two identical balls
in which the second ball is at rest. v
When there is collision of two balls, there is @Q- (@) =o
a transfer of momentum from one ball to another. tia
The ball at rest gains momentum and starts
maving whereas the striking ball slows down. If Vi=o yay,
x 1
the balls are identical, we will observe that there is (2) O ,
a total transfer of momentum. The striking ball Hig: 327
comes to rest and the other ball starts moving with the same speed (Fig.3. 27). It
means that second ball gains momentum equal to that lost by the first one. If the
first ball stops after collision, the second ball moves with the momentum of the
first ball. This suggests that the total: momentum of the two balls after collision
remains the same as total momentum before collision.
The principle of conservation
of momentum is applicable
not only to macro-objects
but also for micré=objects
like atoms and.molécules.

Example 3.5
A bullet of mass m, is fired by a gun of mass mz. Find the velocity of the
gunin termsof velocity of bullet v; just after firing.
Solution
Before firing, the velocity of bullet as well as that of gun was zero.
Therefore, total momentum of bullet and gun was also zero. After firing, the
bullet moves forward with velocity v; whereas the gun moves with velocity vz.

stationary ball of mass 2 kg and then both of them move together. If the friction is

Mass of first ball =m,=3kg
Velocity of first ball before collision =vy=5ms"
Mass of second ball =m,=2kg
Velocity of second ball before collision =v,=0

A force is a push ora pull that starts, stops and changes the magnitude and direction
of velocity
of a body.
Acontact force is a force that acts at the point of contact between two objects.
Non-contact
force is a force between two objects which are not in physical contact.
Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear
force are the four fundamental forces in nature.
Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them. This is known as Newton's law of gravitation.
Newton's first law of motion states that a body continues its state of rest or of uniform
motion with the same constant velocity, unless acted upon by some.net external
force. Pao bs
The property of a body to maintain its state of rest or of unii m-motion is called
inertia.
The second law of motion states that when a net force acts upon a body, it produces
an acceleration in the direction of force and the maghitude of acceleration is directly
proportional to the force and is inversely propo!
The third law of motion states that to wanes‘a

Action and reaction do not act onthe same W4y but act on two different bodies.
Mass of a body is the quantity of matter in it. It determines the magnitude of

scalar quantity

Force meteris a scientifiific instrument that measures forcein newtons (N).
Friction isthe force that tends to prevent the bodies from sliding over each other.
The resisting force between the two surfaces before the motion starts is called the
static friction. The maximum value of the static frictionis called limiting friction.
Thefriction during motion is called kinetic friction.
When a body moves with the help of wheels, the friction in this case is known as
rolling friction. Rolling friction is much less as compared to the sliding friction.
Energy is wasted in doing work against friction that appears in the form of heat.
When upward air resistance balances the downward force of gravity on a falling
object, it falls down with constant (safe) velocity, itis called terminal velocity.
The product of mass and velocity ofamoving body is called momentum.
The principle of conservation of momentum states that if no external force acts on an

As we know, a force is a vector quantity, so it acts in a particular direction.
We observe various effects of forces. Some forces produce acceleration or
decelerating in a body, some tend to turn it around a point and some forces
balance each other acting in opposite directions.
All those forces which act parallel to one another are known as parallel
forces. The points of application of such forces may be different.

4.1 Like and Unlike Parallel Forces
If the parallel forces are acting in the same i
direction, then they are called like parallel forces and F,
if their directions are opposite to one another, they
are called unlike parallel forces. Three forces F,, F,
and F, are shown in Fig. 4.1 acting on a rigid body at
different points. Here, the forces F, and F, are like a
parallel forces but F, and F, are unlike parallel forces. Fig. 4.1
4.2 Addition of Forces
In chapter 2, we have learnt about vectors and their‘representation.
Remember that the resultant is the same for any order of addition of vectors. As
forces are vectors, so forces can also be added by head-to-tail,rule.
To determine the resultant of two or more forces.acting in a plane, the
following example will explain its method.
Example 4.1
Let us add three force vectors F,, F, and F, having magnitudes of 200 N,
300 N and 250 N acting at angles of 30°45°, 60° with x-axis. By selecting a
suitable scale 100 N = 1 cm, we can‘draw
the force vectors as shown in Fig. 4.2(a).
To add these vectors;we apply

4.3 Turning Effect of a Force
We have learnt so far that a net force affects the liner motion of an object
by causing it to accelerate. Since rigid objects can also rotate, so we need to
extend our concept to the turning effect of a force. When we open or close a
door, we apply force. This force rotates the door about its hinge. This is called
turning effect of force. Similarly, we use turning effect of force when we open or
close a water tap. Let us define some terms used in the study of turning effect of a
force.
If the distance between two points of the body remains the same under
the action of a force, it is called a rigid body. Axis ofrotation
During rotation, all the particles of the rigid body
rotate along fixed circles as shown in Fig. 4.3. The straight
line joining the centres of these circles is called the axis of.
rotation. In this case, itis OZ. To observe the turning effect
ofa force, let us perform an activity.
Q
Take your class to play ground where
a see-saw is available. Let a lighter child sits
on the left side and the heavier one on the
right side of the see-saw. The dane
both the children from the pivot should be'equal. The force exerted by each child is equal to his
weight acting downward. Does th vier child move down? Yes, because he is exerting
larger force. Now move the heavi ild nearer to the pivot and the lighter child away from
the pivot as shown in the NOUR ‘the students what
do they observe?
LP.
Moment arm
You will see that the see-saw tilts to the opposite direction and the lighter
child moves down..This shows that the turning effect of a force does not depend
only on its magnitude but also on the location where it acts. Therefore, we can
say that the-greater the force, the greater is its turning effect. Moreover, the
larger the perpendicular distance of the force from the axis of rotation, the
greater is its turning effect.
7
The moment arms of both the children are shown in the figure of
activity 4.1. There are many other examples to observe the tuming or rotational
effect of a force. It is harder to open a door by pushing it at a point closer to the

hinge as compared to push it at the handle (Fig. 4.4). That is why, door or window
handles are always installed at larger distances from hinges to
produce larger moment of force by applying less force. This makes
the doors be opened or closed more easier. Similarly, it requires
greater force to open a nut by a spannerif you hold it closer such as
pointA than point B(Fig.4.5). F

Moment
of Force
The turning effect of a force is measured by a
quantity known as moment of force or torque.
The magnitude of torque is given by

Wheret (tau) is the torque and ¢ is (| of bottle opener. A small

that the torque of a forceis zero when the line of action of a force passes macs
the axis of rotation, becatise its moment arm becomes zero. The torque is
positive if the force tends)to produce an anticlockwise rotation about the axis,
and it is taken as negative if the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation. The
Sl unit of torque is:newton metre (N m).
In many-cases, the line joining the axis of rotation and point P where the
force F acts, is not perpendicular to the force F. Therefore, OP will not be the
moment arm for F. In such cases, we have to find a component of force F
perpendiculars to OP = (Fig. 4.7), or we can find r the component of ¢ that is
perpendicular to the (line of action) force F (Fig. 4.8).
Fsin@ ,--

For this, we need to know the method of finding rectangular components of a
force or any vector. This is also called as resolution of Forces.
Couple
A couple is a special type of torque. We observe at many situations in our
daily life, when two equal and opposite parallel forces produce torque. For
example, while opening or closing a water tap,
turning key in the lock, opening the lid of a jar and
turning steering wheel of a motor car, we apply a
pair of equal forces in opposite directions. The
torque produced in this way in known as couple.
While turning a vehicle, a couple is applied onmn the steering
wheel. It is interesting to know that now-a-days, steéring
wheels of smaller diameter are installed in vehicles. The reason
is that, most of the vehicles are provided with powér steering in i
which a pump pushes hydraulic fluid to reduce~the force
needed to turn the wheels, resulting in effortless steering.
Example 4.2

the end ofa spanner showninFig. 4.10, what is the torque acting on the nut?
Solution

Force = F=400N Om
Torque T=? j aig. 4.10
From Eq. (4.1), t=Fx?
Putting the values, 7=400N x 0.25m=100Nm
4.4 Resolution of Vectors
By head-to-tail rule, two or more vectors can be added to give a resultant
vector. Its reverse process is also possible, i.e., a given vector can be divided into
two or more parts. These parts are called as components of the given vector. If
these components are added up, their resultant is equal to the given vector. To
divide a force into its components is known as resolution ofa force.
a

Usually, a force is resolved into two Beamof light
components which are perpendicular to
each other. These are called its perpendicular
or rectangular components of the force.
Let us resolve a force F into its
perpendicular components, A force F acting
ona body at an angle 0 with x-axis is shown in
Fig. 4.11(a). Imagine a beam of light is placed
above the vector F. As the light falls
perpendicularly to the x-axis, it will cast a
shadow OAof vector Fontox-axis. We call
this shadow as x-component of vector F. In
the same way, if light is thrown perpendicular
to y-axis, the shadow OB of vector F on y-axis
isthe y-component of F.
F,
Fig. 4.11(b)
The x and y components can*be practically drawn simply by dropping
perpendiculars from the tip of vector F ontoxand y-axes respectively. The
x-component of force F is denoted as F, and y-componentas F,.
From Fig. 4.11(b), it is evident that F is the resultant vector of components
F,and F,, Moreover, F, and,F, are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, F, and F,
are called perpendicular,components ofvector F.
The magnitudes of the perpendicular components can be found from the

4.7 Centre of Gravity and Centre of Mass
An object is composed of a large number of small particles. Each particle is
acted upon by the gravitational force directed towards the centre of the
Earth (Fig. 4.14-a). Asithe object is small as compared to the Earth, the value ofg
can be taken as\wniform over all particles. Therefore, each particle experiences
the same force mg. Since all these forces are parallel and act in the same
direction, so their resultant as shown in Fig. 4.14(b) will be equal to the sum of all
these forces .i.e,
Resultant force=5mg where )meansthe “sum of”.
Fig. 4.14(a) | 4 Fig. 4.14(b) ]
Gravitational force acting Resultant gravitational force
on various particles
= 0.6m

We know that the sum of the gravitational forces acting on all particles is
equal to the total weight of the object w= Mg Where M = Ym = massof the
object.
If a body is supported at its centre of gravity, it stays there without
rotation. The centre of gravity of an object of regular shape lies at its geometrical
centre. Centre of gravity of some geometrical shapesis given in Table 4.1.

Round plate Centre of the plate
Sphere Centre of the sphere
Cylinder Centre of the-axis
Metre rule Centre.of the rod
Centre of Gravity ofa Plane Lamina
For an irregular shaped plane lamina, the centre of gravity can be found
by suspending it freely through different points (Fig. 4.15-a). Each time the object
is suspended, its centre of gravity lies on 8 ieee
the vertical line drawn fram the point of suspeniion:
suspension with the héelp’of a plumb line.
The exact positionofthe centre of gravity is
at the point whete two such lines cross
each other ~as,shown in Fig 4.15(b). The
centre of gravity can exist inside a body or
outside the body as is in case of acup.
Centre of Mass
Newton's second law of motion is applicable to
single particle or system of particles. Even when the
parts of a system have different velocities and
acceleration, there is still one point in the system whose
acceleration could be found by applying second law.| Centre of gravity ofa bowl
This pointis called the centre of mass of the system. be Outside the material

Hence, the centre of mass behaves as ifall the mass of the body or system
is lying at that point. In the Fig. 4.16 given below, a rotating wrench slides along a
frictionless floor. There is no resultant force on the wrench. Therefore, its centre
of mass, shown by a yellow dot, follows a linear path with constant speed.

On the surface of the Earth, where g is almost uniform, the centre of mass
of an object coincides with its centre of gravity.
4.8 Equilibrium
We have learnt how translatory ahd rotational motion can be caused due
to the application of external forces. Now, we shall see how external forces can be
balanced to produce no translational or Do You Know?
rotational effects. .
We know that if a numberof forces act ona
body such that their resultant is zero, the body
remains at rest or continues to move with
uniform velocity ifalready in motion. This state
of the body is knewn as equilibrium, which can Thi
be stated as: scene of equilibrium.
There are two types of equilibrium:
(i) Staticequilibrium —_ (ii) Dynamic equilibrium
A body at rest is in static equilibrium whereas a body moving with uniform
velocity is in dynamic equilibrium.
An example of static equilibrium is a book lying on the table as shown in
Fig. 4.17. Only two forces are acting on it. One is its weight w = mg acting
a

downward and the other is F, the normal force that the
table exerts upward on the book. Since the book is at rest
so, it has zero acceleration. Therefore, the sum of all the
forces acting on the book should be zero, so that the
bookis said to be in equilibrium. Hence
F,-w=0 Fig. 4.17
or FL=w Book is in static equilibrium
This means that forces can act on a body without
accelerating it, provided these forces balance each Rope
other. wal
An electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a Beam
room, a man holding a box, a beam held horizontal
against a wall with the help of a rope and a hanging
weight (Fig. 4.18), are all examples of static equilibrium.
A good example of dynamic equilibrium) is a
paratrooper (Fig. 4.19). In a few second after'the free
fall, the parachute opens and a littlelater, the
Paratrooper starts descending with a.uniform velocity.
In this state, the force of gravity jacting vertically
downward on the paratrooper is balanced by the
resistance of air
on the parachute acting upward. Fig. 4.19
4.9 Conditions of Equil m A paratrooper is in dynamic equilibrium

There
are two conditions of equilibrium: Foscinating Freeta
First Condition of Equilibrium
By Newton’s second law of motion, F= ma
Ifthe body is in translational equilibrium, then a= 0,
therefore, net force Fshouldbe0O or }F=0........ (4.7)
This is the mathematical form of the first =
condition of equilibrium which states that: A group of paratroopers making

dynamic equilibrium.
Fig. 4.18 Weight
A beam projected from a wall
is also in static equilibrium
In case a number of coplanar forces F,, F,, F,, .... having their resultant
equal to F, are acting on a body, these can be resolved into their rectangular
a

components, and first condition of equilibrium can be then written as:
Alongx-direction, — F,, + Fx, + Fy, +... = 0
or TRO we (4.8)
Similarly, along y-direction,
Fgh gt Payton =0
or TF=0 wssees(4.9)
Thus, first condition of equilibrium can also be stated as:
Second Condition of Equilibrium
The second condition of equilibrium implies to the rotational equilibrium
which means that the body should not rotate under the action of the forces.
Consider the example of a rigid body in Fig.4.20.) Two forces F, and F, of
equal magnitude are acting on it. In case (a), both the forces act along the same
line of action.
(a) Fig. 4.20 (b)
In case (b), the lines.of)action of the two forces are different. Since
magnitude of F, and F, are equal, so the resultant force is zero in both the cases.
Thus, first condition of equilibrium is satisfied. But you can observe that in case
(b), the forces are forming a couple which can apply torque to rotate the body
about point O. Therefore, for a body to be completely in equilibrium, a second
condition is.also>required. That is, no net torque should be acting. This is the
second condition of equilibrium which can be stated as:
Mathematically, we can write: yr=0 weeee(4.10)
Hence, a body will be in complete equilibrium when,

4.10 States of Equilibrium
An object is balanced when its centre of mass and _its.point of support lie on
the same vertical line. Then forces on each side are balanced, and the object is
said to be in equilibrium. There are three states of equilibrium in connection with
stability of the balanced bodies.
Stable Equilibrium

The cone shown in Fig 4.22(a) is in the state of stable equilibrium. Its weightw

equilibrium are satisfied. 8
As you try to push over the cone slightly, its centre of gravity is raised but it
still remains above the base of the cone. The weight w and the normal force F, do
not remain in equilibrium. Unlike parallel forces produce a clockwise torque
which brings the cone back to its original position. It is worth noting that the
body remains in equilibrium as long its centre of mass lies within the base.
Stable equilibrium occurs when the torques arising from the on (tilt) of
G and the reaction,of the floor F, acting
other and both the conditions of (a
not remain in the same line but act like two unlike parallel forces. The cone does
a

Unstable Equilibrium
Try to balance the cone on its tip. It is balanced for a moment because w and
F, lie along the same line. Even it is slightly tilted, it will not come back to its
original position by itself. Rather it will fall downward, because its centre of mass
no longer remains above the base. It
topples over, because line of action of wno
longer lies inside the base O (Fig. 4.23). In
this case, centre of gravity is lowered on
tilting and continues to fall further. It
cannot rise up again because the
anticlockwise torque produced by w
moves it further downward.
Neutral Equilibrium
A cylinder resting on a horizontal surface{Fig. 4.24) shows the neutral
equilibrium. If the cylinder is rotated slightly;there is no force or torque that
brings it back to its original position or moves it away. As the F
cylinder rotates, the height of the centre of mass remains
unchanged. In any position of the(cylinder, its weight and
reaction of the ground lie in the same vertical line. lw Fig. 4.24
Other examples of neutral equilibrium are a ball rolling
on a horizontal surfaces, or a cone resting on its curved
surface (Fig.4.25), Fig. 4.25
4.11 Improvement of Stability
It is our daily life observation that a low armchair is more stable than a high
chair because of its low centre of gravity. The
position of centre of gravity is very important when
we are talking about stability. A bus can be stable or
unstable depending on how it is loaded. If the heavy
loads are placed on the floor of the bus, its centre of
gravity will be low. Now if it is disturbed slightly, a
torque will bring it back to its original position.
ro
A double decker busis bei
tilting to test its stability.

In this case, the bus is in stable equilibrium. If the same bus is loaded with
steel sheets on the top, the centre of gravity be raised. It is now near to a state of
unstable equilibrium.A couple will turn it over if itis slightly tilted. The same is the
case of ships and boats. We can improve the stability of a system either by
lowering the centre of gravity
or by widening the base.
Interesting Information! » »
An unstable equilibrium is illustrated in this
/
/ G
figure. A chair in normal position is quite
stable (Fig. a) but it has been turned into an
unstable position by tilting it back on its legs
(Fig. b). In this tilted position, a couple is
formed by its weight
w and reaction F, of the
ground. This clockwise couple tends to
overturn chair backward. (a)
4.12 Application of Stabi in Real Life
The concept of stability is widely applied to engineering technology
especially in manufacturing racing cars and balancing toys.
As the racing cars are driven at very/high speeds and also there are sharp
turns in the track, therefore, the chanceS)ofthe cars to topple over increase. To
enhance the stability of racing carstheir centres of mass are kept as low as
possible. There base areas are also\increased by keeping the wheel outside of
their main bodies. Balancing toys are also very interesting for both children and
elders. Look at some balancing toys shown belows.

Fig. 4.26; Balancing toys
The physics behind these types of toys is that stability is built in with
balancing toys. These toys are basically in completely stable state and their
centres of gravity always remain below the pivot point. If the toys are disturbed in
any direction, the centre of gravity is raised and it becomes unstable for a
moment. It comes back to its initial stable position by lowering its centre of
gravity. ie

The kids learn from these toys about stable systems and how they return to
their state of initial rest position after being disturbed. Educational games on the
basis of balancing toys have also been developed for the kids as
shown in Fig 4.27.

Rotational Motion Versus Translatinal Motion)
Counterparts of velocity, acceleration, force and momentum in
translational motion are angular velocity, angular acceleration, moment of force
(torque) and angular momentum respectively‘in rotational motion. It suggests
that the torque plays the same role in the rotational motion that is played by the
force in the translational motion. Therefore, we are justified to predict that
analogous to Newton's first law of motion, a rotating object will continue to do
so with constant angular velocity Ghless acted upon by a resultant moment
(torque). However, if a resultanttorque is applied to rotating object, it will
accelerate depending on the.direction of the torque relative to the axis of
rotation.
This fundamental-principle enhances our understanding how objects
move and interact with their environment whether in linear or rotational motion
scenarios.
Motion
ina Circle.
When a body is moving along a circular path, its
velocity at any point is directed along the tangent
drawn at that point. Figure 4.28 shows that the direction
of tangent at each point on a circle is different,
therefore, the velocity of an object moving with uniform
speed in a circle is changing constantly. Hence, a force
perpendicular to the direction of motion is always Fig. 4.28
required to keep the object moving with uniform speed in a circular path.

It should be noted that F is essentially perpendicular to v. For an instance,
if it is not perpendicular to v, the force F will have a component in the direction of
v. This will change the magnitude of velocity. As the body moves with constant
speed, so itis possible only if the component of force along vis Fcos 90° = 0.
4.13 Centripetal Force
We have studied above that an object can move in a circular path with
uniform speed only if a force perpendicular to its velocity is acting constantly on
it. This force is always directed towards the centre of the circle. It is called
centripetal force and can be defined as:
For an object of mass m moving with uniform speed. in circle of radius r,
the magnitude of centripetal force F, acting on it can be calculated by using the
relation:
Example 4.5
A 150 g stone attached to a String is whirled in a horizontal circle at a
constant speed of 8 ms”. The length-of string is 1.2 m. Calculate the centripetal
force acting on the stone. Neglecteffects of gravity.
Solution
Mass ofstone =m = 150 g= 0.15 kg
Speed'of stone =v = 8ms"
Radius ofcircle =r = 1.2m
Gentripetal force= F,=?
Using Eq.4.11, pte

Putting the values, F= a 15 kg x (8 ms’)
1.2m
Sources of Centripetal Force
We have learnt that centripetal force has to be
supplied if the body is to be maintained in its circular
Fig. 4.29(a)
path. What could be the sources of centripetal force?
ig-
a Astone whirled in a circle by a string

If we tie a stone to one end ofa string and whirl it from the other end, we
will have to exert a force on the stane through the string (Fig 4.29-a). If we release
the string when itis at any point P, the stone will fly Q
off along the tangent (PQ) to the circle. Then, it will ¥ op
move along the same straight line with constant =
velocity unless an unbalanced force acts upon it.
In fact, the tension T in the string was
providing the stone the necessary centripetal force
to keep it along the circular path (Fig 4.29-b).
When we release the string we stop applying force
onthe stone and hence it movesin a straight line. Fig,(4.29 (b)
Now consider the case of the moon which
moves around the Earth at constant speed. The
gravity of the Earth provides the necessaryy ©
centripetal force to keep it in its orbit. Same is the
case of satellites orbiting the Earth in circularpaths
with uniform speed. The gravitational pull of the Fig. 4.30
Earth provides centripetal force.
Asatellite orbiting the Earth
One of the real life examples-is a washing
machine dryer. A dryer is a metallic cylinderical
drum with many small holes inits walls. Wet clothes
are put in it. When the-cylinder rotates rapidly,
friction between clothes-and drum walls provides
necessary centripetalforce. As the water molecules
are free to move;so they cannot get the required Fig. 4.31
centripetal force to move in circular paths and Washing machine
escape from the drum through the holes. This
results into quick drying of clothes.
Another interesting example is that of a
cream separator. In a cream separator, milk is
whirled rapidly.
Cream seperator
Fig. 4.32
ee

The lighter particles of cream experience less centripetal force and gather
in the central part of the machine. The heavier particles of milk need greater
centripetal force to keep their circular motion in circles of small radius r. In this
way, they move away towards the walls.

Work and energy are important
concepts in physics as well as in our everyday
life. Commonly the word ‘work’ covers all sort
of activities whether mental or physical. If a
girl is studying (Fig. 5.1) or a man is standing
(Fig. 5.2) with a load of bricks on his head, we
say that they are doing work. But according to
physics, work has a specific definition. Work is
said to be done when a force acts on an object
and moves it through some distance.
The concept of energy is closely associated with that of
work, when work is done by one system on another,
energy is transferred between the two systems.
In this chapter, we will define work, energy, power
and efficiency and show how they are related to one
another.
Force and distance are two essential elements of work. When a constant force
acting ona body moves it through somedistance, we say that ‘the force has done
work’,
Work is defined as ae of magnitude of force
and the distance’c vered in the direction of force.
Consider a block of wood lying on a
table (Fig. 5.3). If we_exert a force F on the
block to move it through a distance S in the 4
direction of forcepthen the work W done by «< —
the forceis:
Work = Magnitude of force x Distance
or WHFS ccssssesseern (5.1)
From Eq. (5.1), it can be concluded that if some force is
acting on a body but there is no displacement, then no
work is done. For example, a man is pushing hard a wall
but the wall remains fixed in its place. In this case, the man
is doing no work (Fig. 5.4).
Similarly, if a force acting on the body is zero and the body
is moving with uniform velocity, work will be zero.
AsF=0 so W=0xS=0

What will be the work done when a force is F F
acting on a body making an angle 8 with the
direction of motion? In this case, work is done a a
due to the component of force which is acting Fos +, —>
along the direction of motion (Fig. 5.5). . Fig. 5.5
Resolving the force F into its components, we have
the componentF cos6 that acts in the direction of motion. Therefore,
W = (Fcos@) S
or W=FS cos 6...... (5.2)
If is zero, cos 0° = 1, then
W=FS(1)=FS
This is the case when force and distance covered [95
are in the same direction. Now if @ = 90°, then! Fore ("3
cos 90° = 0 which means the force has zero”
component in the direction of motion. Thus, j
W=FS(0)=0 ;
This is the case when force is perpendicular
to the displacement. Look at Fig. 5.6\it suggests =
that if a person carries a bag to somedistance, this |. =~
work is zero, because the force‘applied to hald the Fig. 5.6
load is upward which is perpendicular
to the displacement.
The work done to‘push an object is the same whether the object moves
north to south or east to west, provided the magnitude of force and the distance
moved are not changed. Work does not convey any directional information, so it
is a scalar quantity.
Calculation of Work Done by Graph
When a constant force Facts through adistance S, Pf --
the event can be plotted on a force-distance graph as Shaded area
shown in Fig. 5.7. If the force and distance covered are in work done
the same direction, the work done is Fx S.
Clearly the shaded area in the figure is also F x S.
Hence, the area under a force-distance curve can be
taken to represent the work doneby that force.

Units of Work
The SI unit of work is joule (J).
One joule work is done when a force of one newton acting on a body
moves it through a distance of one metre in its own direction.
From Eq. (5.1)
1J=1Nxim
or 1J=Nm
Bigger units arealsousedlike 1kJ=10°J and 1MJ=10°J

Our body cannot move unless we have energy
from food. A car would not run without the energy it
obtains from burning fuel. Machines in the factories
cannot run without consuming energy supplied by
electricity. Any change in motion requires energy. When
we say that a certain body has energy, we mean that it
has theability
of doing work.

on which work is done. In other words, the energy is _* oe
transferred from one system to another. For example, XO
when you do work pushing a swing, chemical energy in your body is transferred

‘\
When one joule workis done ona body, the amount of energy spentis one joule.
There are many forms of energy. Electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear
energy, heat energy and light energy are some well-known farms which we shall
study later on. There are two basic forms of energy:
(i) Kinetic energy
(ii) Potential energy
The combination of these two types of energies is called mechanical energy.
Kinetic Enetgy
The kinetic energy of a body is the energy
that a body possesses by virtue of its motion.
To find out how much kinetic energy a moving body possesses, an opposite
force can be applied on the body to stop its motion, Then the work done by
the force will be equal to the kinetic energy of the body. i.e., Kinetic energy
(E,) = Workdone(W)
Suppose a body of mass m is moving with velocity v. An opposing force F acting
onthe body through a distance

Potential Energy,
In the previous section, we have seen that the work done ona body is used
to increase its\kinetic energy. Sometimes, the work done on a body does not
increase its kinetic energy, rather it is stored in the body as potential energy.
Potential energy is defined as the energy that a body
possesses by virtue of its position or deformation.
Forms of Potential Energy
There are many forms of potential energy. As
mentioned above, the energy possessed by an object S ? #]

ee

The energy stored in a compressed or stretched spring is called elastic
potential energy and the potential energy in the chemicals of a battery is called
chemical potential energy, which is changed to electrical energy by chemical
reactions. Thermal or internal energy is released by burning fossil fuels i.e. coal,
oil or gas through chemical reactions.
Nuclear energy is the hidden energy in the nuclei of atoms, When they
are broken, energy is released in the form of heat and some other radiations. This
is called nuclear fission.
If the block shown in Fig. 5.10 is lifted to a height mm
h above the ground, then the block would have F
potential energy in that raised position. Therefore, it h
has the ability to do work whenever it is allowed to fall.
How should potential energy be measured? Because wy Fig. 5.10
workis done on the block to put it into the position where ithas potential energy,
therefore, we can say that the work done is stored in itas potential energy. Thus,
potential energy £, is given by

5.3 Conservation of Energy
The study of various forms of energy and the transformation of one kind
of energy into another has led to a very important principle known as the
principle of conservation of energy. Formally, itis stated as:
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It may be transioggg irom one form
to another, but the total amount of energy never changes.»
During energy transfer process, some energy’seems to be lost and not
accounted for in calculations. This loss of energy is\due to work done against
friction of the moving parts in the process. This’energy appears as heat and is
dissipated in the environment. This energy does’not remain available for doing
some useful work and may be called waste energy.
A process of energy conversion ‘and conservation can be described with
the given example.
Let a body of mass m be.at rest at a point A above the a WRU
height4 from the ground (Fig.5:12). Its total energy PE. is mgh,
E,= mgh
and &,=0 BCU] |e
Then the body is allowed to drop to point B at a height
x from the
ground. The body loses potential energy and gains kinetic *
energy as it_gets) speed while falling down. Assuming air C
resistance negligible. Fig. 5.12
E,= mg (h-x)
The loss of potential energy will appear as the gain in kinetic energy, hence, at
pointB
E,= mgx
TotalenergyatB E=mg(h-x)+mgx = mgh
Just before hitting the ground at point C, the whole of potential energy is
changed into kinetic energy. Thus,
E,=0 and £=mgh
Thus, total energy remains the same as mgh. On hitting the ground, this
energy is dissipated as heat and sound in the environment.

5.4 Sources of Energy
Fossil Fuel Energy —
Fossil fuel energy comes out from burning of oil,
coal and natural gas. These materials are known as fossil
fuels. The burning of these fuels gives out heat which is
used to generate steam that runs the turbines to
produce electricity. A block diagram of the process _gefore electricity was

Solar Energy
Sun is the biggest source of energy. The energy obtained from sunlight is
referred to as solar energy. Solar energy can be used in two ways, Either it can be
used for heating system or can be converted to electricity. In one way, solar
panels absorb heat of the Sun. They consist of large metal plates which are
painted black (Fig. 5.15). Heat can be used for warming houses or running water
heating system. If solar radiation is concentrated to a small surface area by using
large reflectors or lenses, reasonably high temperature can be achieved.

Geothermal Energy —
In some parts of the world, hot rocks AY
are present in the semi molten form deep Ae) iuspine Generator
under the surface of the Earth. They are \ ~_/ _.
heated by energy released due to decay, of C =
radioactive elements. The temperature of
these rocks is about 250°C. This energy is

To make use of the heat of the rocks, two
holes are drilled up to the rocks. Cold water
is pumped down through one of the holes. It
is heated up by the hot rocks and starts
boiling. Steam is produced that comes out
through the other hole. The steam runs the
generator which produces electricity. Where
there is water already present over the hot
rocks, it comes out of the surface of the Earth in the form of hot springs and
geysers. Such a geyser is shown in Fig. 5.18.

For thousands of years, people have
been using windmills to draw water from the

The gravitational force for the moon gives rise to'tides in the seas. The tide
raises the water level near the sea shore twice a day. The rise and fall of water can
be utilized to turn on turbine for electricity generation. The water at high tides
can be trapped at a suitable location, a basin, » by building a dam. The water is
then released in a controlled way at low tide’to drive the turbines for producing
electricity. At next high tide, the damiis filled again and the incoming water also
drives turbines.
The tides and winds*blowing over the surface of the sea produce strong
water waves.
Their energy’can be used to generate [PM Sic\5 Balance float
electricity. Thé-method to harness wave
energy is to use large floats which move up
and down with the waves. One such device
invented by Prof. Salter is known as Salter's
duck (Fig.5.20). It consists of two parts.
Fig. 5.20
(i) Duck float (ii) Balanced float
The energy of the water waves causes duck float to move relative to the balance
float. The relative motion of the duck float is used to drive the electricity

Biofuel Energy
It is that energy which is obtained from the
biomass. Biomass consists of organic
materials such as plants, waste foods,
animals dung, sewage, etc. Sewage is that
dirt which is left over after staining dirty
water. The material can itself be used as fuel
orcan be converted into other types of fuels.
Direct combustion is a method in which
biomass, commonly known as solid waste, is
burnt to boil water and produce steam. The
steam can be used to generate electricity. In
another process, the rotting of biomass in a
closed tank called a ‘digester’ produces
methane rich biogas (Fig. 5.21). In this
process, micro-organisms break down
biomass material in the absence of oxygen,
Biogas produced in the tank is piped outand
can be used for heating and cooking“like
natural gas.

5.5 Renewable and
Non-Renewable Sources
The resources of energy which are replaced
by new ones after their use are called

non-renewable sources are those, which are
depleted with the continuous use. Once they,

ones. Sources such as hydroelectricity, solar|

Economic, Social and Environmental
Impact of Various Energy Sources
Fossil fuels is a common source of
energy but it is very expensive. It also
produces pollution that affects the
human health badly. On the other
hand, hydroelectric energy is the
cheapest source of energy. It does not
produce pollution. It has only one
negative point that it may cause water
logging by raising the water table
under the nearby lands.
The use of solar energy, wind energy,
tidal energy, etc. is pollution free. Only
the initial cost is high in the use of these
sources.
Nuclear energy is very desirable source.
It is cheaper and can meet the
increasing demands of energy easily.
energy, wind energy, tidal energy, wave energy and geothermal energy are
renewable. These are replaced by new ones. For example, snow fall and rain fall

are continuous processes. Therefore, water supply to the reservoirs of dams for
generation of hydroelectric power will never end up. Likewise, solar energy will
remain available forever. Same is the case with wind and tidal energy. These are
not going to run outin future.
Non-renewable sources include fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The remnants of
plants and animals buried under the Earth took millions of years to change into
fossil fuels. These fuels are in limited quantity. Once they are used up, it will take
further millions of years to form new ones. Similarly, fuels for the nuclear energy
are also limited.
As the need for energy is increasing day by day, there is need to develop other
non- traditional renewable energy sources.

direct pollution to atmosphere. carbondioxideinto the atmosphere
every year.
Windmills are very noisy. Some people think that wind turbines spoil the beauty
of landscape.
Nuclear power generators are also run by steam produced by nuclear
heat energy. Heat itself is a form of pollution. Moreover, there is always danger of
leakage of the radioactive radiation which is harmful to living bodies. People
living around nuclear plants are always at risk. The disposal of nuclear waste is
another problem for the nuclear power generation. However, any form of waste
energy ends up as thermal energy that goes to the environment. Thus, thermal
pollution is increasing day by day causing global warming.

In many cases, the time to do work is as important as the amount of work
done. Suppose you walk up to a height ‘h’ through upstairs (Fig. 5.26). You do
work, because you are lifting your body up the stairs. If you run up, you can reach
the same height ina shorter time interval.
hefgtit A)

Fign5.26
The work done is the same in either,ease, because the net result is that you lifted
up the same weight wto the same height h. But you know that if you run up the
stairs, you would be more tired than you walked up slowly. In fact, there is a
difference in the rate at whi¢hwork is done. We say that you expend more energy
when you go up the stairstapidly than when you go slowly.
The concept of power can also be explained with another example of an electric
motor or a water,pump. A bigger motor draws more water during the same
interval of time-as compared to a smaller one. It is said that the power of bigger
motor is greater than that of smaller one.
Power is defined as the time rate of doing work.

Percentage Efficiency= Wianiil power aiaipiit 100 ereeseseee (5.6)
Total power input
Itis found that the energy output is always less than the energy input. During any
conversion of energy, some energy is wasted in the form of heat. No device has
yet been invented that may convert all the input energy into required output.
That is why a system.cannot have an efficiency of 100 %. As the energy losses are
inevitable in the, working of a machine, hence, an ideal or perpetual machine
cannot be constructed.
Perpetual Energy Machines
It is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely, without any
external source of energy. A perpetual machine would have to generate more
energy than it consumes, effectively producing energy from nothing, which is
impossible. In any real mechanical system, some energy is always lost as heat due
to friction between moving parts and air resistance etc. Thus, making it
impossible for a machine to keep moving without an external source of energy.
Infact, it is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy that a
perpetual energy machine is not workable.

You have learnt in lower classes that every thing around us is made up of
matter. The matter normally exists in solid, liquid and gaseous states. These
states are due to attractive force that exists between the atoms and molecules.
We have already studied some basic properties of matter. In this chapter, we will
discuss mechanical properties of matter that are of vital importance of a material
for various useful purposes in technology and engineering. The main contents
included in this chapter are: deformation of solids due to some applied force,
density and pressure.
6.1 Deformation of Solids
We have observed that an external force applied
onan object can change its size or shape. Such a force is
known as deforming force. For example, an appropriate
force applied to a spring can increase its length called
extension or cause compression thus reducing, its
length. If this force is removed, the spring will restoreits
original size and shape. Similarly, stretched rubber strip
or band comes to its original shape and\size on
removing the applied force.
Whena tennis ball is hit by a racket, the. shapes of tennis
ball and also racket strings are distorted or deformed
(Fig. 6.1). They regain their original shape after

deformation produced under the action of a force. deforming force. They
Most ofthe materials are elastic up to a certain 4" known as inelastic
limit known as elastic limit. Beyond the elastic limit, the mete
change becomes permanent. The object or material does not regain its original
shape or size even after the removal of the deforming force.
6.2 Hooke’s Law
Ifa force Fis applied on a spring to stretch or compress it, the extension or
compression x has been found directly proportional to the applied force within
the elastic limit. Thus, Frese F

it is a measure of stiffness of the spring. The greater the value of spring constant,
the greater will be the stiffness or strength of the
spring. Its unitis Nm”.
A graph of force against extension is a straight
line passing through the origin. If the applied force or
load exceeds the elastic limit of the spring, it is |(N)
permanently deformed and its graph will no longer fo)
remain linear. The gradient or slope of force-extension
graph is a measure of spring constant k.

Applications of Hooke's Law
Hooke's law serves as the basic principle in wide range of applications. In
the field of technology and engineering, springs in many devices rely on Hooke's
law for their functions such as spring scales, balance wheel of the mechanical
clocks, galvanometer, suspensions system in vehicles and motorbikes, door
hinges, mattresses, material testing machines, etc.
However, Hooke's law applies within a
specific range of forces. Exceeding the range or
limit results in permanent deformation and no
longer follows Hooke's law. Some of the uses are
elaborated below:
1. Spring scales
Spring scales use the extension or
compression of a spring to determine the weight
of objects. In a common spring balance the) |¢
extension or elongation produced is a measure of
the weight. In compression balance, the-spring is
compressed by the load (force) ‘and the
compression produced is measured by means ofa
pointer moving overa scale. Weighing machine usually use this type of balance.
2. Balance wheel of mechanical clocks
The balance wheel in-mechanical clocks use spring to control the back and
forth motion that regulates the speed of the hands of a clock (Fig. 6.4).
3. Galvanometer
Galvanometer is a current detecting
device. It makes use of a tiny spring called hair
spring (Fig. 6.5) which provides electrical
connections to the galvanometer coil and also
restores the pointer back to zero position. The
deflection of the pointer is proportional to the
current flowing through it within the range.

substances and weigh them by a balance, you will

find that each of them has a different mass. That is, one centimetre cube of wood
may weigh only 0.7 g but made of iron will weigh 8.0 g. Why is it so? You know
that all substances are composed of molecules. The molecules of different
substances are different in size and mass. The inter-molecular spacing is also
different.
The mass of equal volume of various substances actually is the mass of the
total number of molecules present in that volume. Naturally, the substance
whose molecules are densely packed and also which are heavy will weigh more
than others.
Density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

If the substance is solid and has a regular shape, its volume can be found
by measuring its dimensions. For example, if the substance is in the form of a

For Your Information! P= A (6.3)
Sports boots for football and hackey have studs on their soles.
They reduce the area in contact between your feet and the
ground. This increases the pressure and your feet grip the surface
more firmly.
ee

The area A on which the force acts is usually referred as contact area.
Equation (6.3) shows that for a certain force, the pressure can be very large if the
contact area
A is small.
In the system international, the unit of pressure is N m” and is called
pascal (Pa).
Daily Life Examples
1. The edge of the blade of a chopper is made
very sharp. When we apply force on the
handle of the chopper to cut an object, the |
pressure on the object, at the contac
surface, due to its small area becomes very
high and the object is easily cut (Fig. 6.6).
2. The top ofa thumb pin is flat but the end of
the pin is very sharp. So, the contact area is
very small. When we apply a force at the top,
the pressure at the end of pin is so high that
it pierces into the wooden board (Fig. 6.7).
3. When we walk on ground, we exert a force
on it due to which we experience a reaction Fig. 6.7 Thumb pin|
force. When the ground is flat, this feaction
force is spread over the whole area‘of the Why a bulldozer has large pillar

is not painful. But when we walk on pebbles,
the contact area is reduced. Then the
pressure due to reactionforce becomes so
high that it becomes painful.
4, Heavy animals like-elephant have thick legs
and large flatwfeet so that due to large
contact area, pressure becomes less
otherwise,their bones would not tolerate the pressure.
6.5 Pressure in Liquids
We have learnt in the lower classes that liquids exert pressure in all
directions. Moreover, liquid pressure increases with depth.
Let us determine the pressure at a certain depth of a liquid. Figure. 6.8
shows a container of liquid. Consider an area A in the liquid at depth h. The force
acting on this area is equal to the weight of the liquid column over surface A. The
volume of this liquid is V = Ah. If pis the density of liquid, then mass m of the
liquid column will be:
m=pV=pAh

Therefore, force acting on areaA will be /
F=mg=pAhg
The pressure Pat areaA will be,
p= F_ _ pAhg
A A
Or P=pgh 6.4)
Equation 6.4 shows that pressure in a
liquid increases with depth. The value of pressure
depends on the depth and density ofthe liquid.
Pressure produces force at right angle to
the surface. A force or its component that is NE
parallel to the surface, does not contribute to | I< fa)
pressure. The pressure, by definition, is only |_Fig- 8,8 Pressure in a liquid
contributed by the normal component of the force. That\is;the forces in a liquid
that push directly against the surface and add up to’a‘net force is perpendicular
to the surface. If there is a hole in the surface ofthe liquid container, the liquid
spurts at right angle to the surface before curving downward due to gravity.
Example 6.2
Calculate the pressure of column of mercury 76 cm high. Density of
mercury is 13.6 x 10’ kg m”.
Solution
Density p= 13.6x10'kgm Some liquids under pressure

solution and rises to the surface
P =1,034x10° Pa of the liquid in the form of
bubbles,
Example 6.3
A ccylindrical water tank 2 m deep has been built on the top of a building
20 m high. What will be the pressure of water at the ground floor when the tank is
full? Density of water is 1000 kg m®. Takeg = 10ms*.

6.6 Atmospheric Pressure
The Earth is surrounded by a layer of air which we call atmosphere. We
know that air is a mixture of gases. Their molecules are always in motion. They
collide with one another and with all other objects coming in their way. Thus, they
exert force on the objects. This force per unit area is the atmospheric pressure.
Since the molecules of air have random motion, therefore, atmospheric pressure
acts equally in all directions.
The atmosphere exerts pressure on the surface of the Earth and on
everything on the Earth. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure.

not the same in the atmosphere. It decreases
We live at the bottom of the Earth's atmosphere which is a fluid that exerts
Pressure on our bodies. At sea level, the value of atmospheric pressure is about
1.013 x 10° Pa. This value is referred to as standard atmospheric pressure. It is an
enormous pressure which can crush anything. We do not feel it because
practically all the bodies have air inside them. As atmospheric pressure acts in all
directions, so it balances the pressure inside.
Evidence of Atmospheric Pressure
We can observe the force of the atmospheric pressure if we remove the
inside air from a vessel as shown in the followingactivity.

We have studied that pressure in a liquid increases with depth. At depth h,
the pressure of liquid is given by
P=pgh
This formula is applicable to all the fluids. As the gases of the atmosphere
are also fluid, therefore, the atmospheric pressure should be maximum on the
ground at sea level. As we go up in the air, atmospheric pressure decreases. At a
height of about 5 km, it falls to 55 kPa and at a height of 30 km, it falls to 1 kPa. By
measuring the atmospheric pressure at a point in air, altitude of that point can be
determined. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the greater is the altitude.

Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure
Atmospheric pressure is usually measured by =
the height of mercury column which it can support. = ed
Instruments which measure the atmospheric
pressure are called barometers. A simple mercury
barometer consists of a glass tube about one metre
long that is closed at one end. It is completely filled
with mercury, then it is inverted vertically in a dish of
mercury. A metre scale is placed by the side
of the tube to measure the height of mercury column
(Fig. 6.9). The space in glass tube over the top of the
mercury is completely empty. The pressure is almost
zero. Fig 6.9 Barometer

Changes in Atmospheric Pressure as Weather Indicator
The atmospheric pressure does not always RET
remain uniform but flactuates. By observing the Can we use water in place
variation, the meteorologists can forecast the of mercury to construct a
weather conditions. barometer? Explain why.
Atmospheric pressure depends upon the
density of air. At high altitudes, where the air is less dense, the atmospheric
pressure falls down. Similarly, increase in the quantity of water vapours also
decreases the density. Thus, atmospheric pressure becomes low in cloudy
regions. Weather casters use this knowledge to predict rains. A fall in pressure
often means that rain clouds are on the way and the rain is to follaw.
6.8 Measurement of Pressure by Manometer
A simple manometer consists of a
U-shaped glass tube which contains mercury. In
the beginning, the atmospheric pressure at the
two open ends of the tube is the same and
hence, mercury level in the two arms remains
same (Fig. 6.10). If on connecting a gas.cylinder
with short arm keeping the longer arm of the
tube open, the mercury level in short arm is
lower than that in the long arm.(Fig. 6.11), then
the unknown pressure is(more than the
atmospheric pressure. If the-mercury level in the
short arm is more than ‘the long arm (Fig.6.12), Fig. 6.10 manometer
then the unknown_pressure is less than the
atmospheric pressure.

Let us perform a very interesting activity with a liquid. Take,water in a flask
with piston and having a few side tubes fixed at different positions. If such flask is
not available you can join a syringe at the mouth of a pet,bottle. For side tubes,
bendable transparent drinking straws can be glued enithe holes punched on
sides of the bottle.
You will observe that the level of water inall.the side tubes is the same. This
is because a liquid seeks its own level and rises to
the same height at all points. Now push thé piston
through some distance.
The level of water in all the side tubes rises
to the same height. Why does this happen? This is
because the pressure applied at‘one point of the
liquid is transmitted equally to.every point of the
liquid. Since gases (air) and liquids are termed as
fluids so the above activities prove that:
When pr is applied at one point in
an en d fluid, it is transmitted
equally.t all parts of fluid without loss.
This is the statement of Pascal's law.
The technology of hydraulic systems is based on Pascal's law. Its main
advantages are:
(I) Liquids do not absorb
any of the supplied energy.
(ii) They are capable of moving much heavy loads and providing great forces
due to incompressibility.
Some useful hydraulic systems are:

2. Carliftatservice stations
3. Hydraulic brakes of vehicles

pistons to move outward pressing the brake pads towards brake discs or brake

Heat or thermal energy has always been the necessity of human beings,
animals and plants in this world. Without heat, their existence would not have
been possible. In the beginning, the Sun was the only source of light and heat.
With the discovery of fire, a new era was started. The uses of heat produced from
fire were increased day by day and contributed greatly to the comforts and
facilities for the human being. Initially, the hot and cold objects were sensed by
touching which was not a good standard to measure the degree of hotness of an

object. So, man evolved different methods to measure it. After the invention of
standard measuring devices, the temperature was also included in the list of
basic physical quantities like mass, length and time.
This chapter begins with the introduction of kinetic molecular theory of
particles of matter. It is due to the fact that temperature and heat or internal
energy are associated with the motion of particles in the matter.
7.1 Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter
According to this theory, matter is composed of very small particles called
molecules which are always in motion. Their motion may be vibrational,
rotational or linear. There exists a mutual force of attraction, between the
molecules known as intermolecular force. This force depends upon the distance
between the molecules. It decreases with increasing distance between them.
The molecules possess kinetic energy due to motion and potential energy
due to force of attraction. When a substance is heated, its temperature rises and
its molecular motion becomes more vigorous whichincreases the kinetic energy
of the molecules. Thus, the temperature of the-substance depends upon the
average kinetic energy of its molecules. In.géneral, matter exists in three states
solids, liquids and gases as shown in Fig. 7.1.
Most of therproperties of solids, liquids and gases
can be explained ‘on the basis of kinetic molecular theory of
matter. In case ‘of solids, the intermolecular forces are so
strong that they keep the molecules bound. So, the
molecules are held at fixed positions but still they show
vibrational motion about their fixed points (Fig. 7.2). This is
why, the solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.
Incase of liquids, intermolecular
force is so weak that
it cannot hold the molecules at fixed positions and the
eee
Oe

molecules can slide over each other in random directions. A liquid, therefore,
possesses a definite volume but has no definite shape.
molecules, it acquires the shape of the containing vessel.
Gas molecules are relatively far away from one and another. Due to which,
gas neither posseses a definite volume nor a definite shape.
Due to flow of the

Plasma
The plasma is a gas in which most of the atoms
are ionized containing positive ions and electrons
(Fig. 7.3-a). They are freely moving in the volume of the
gas. Due to presence of positive ions and free electrons,
plasma is the conducting state of matter. It allows
electric current to pass through it. Since the gas in
plasma state has properties which are quite different
from ordinary gas, therefore, plasma is known as fourth Fig. 7,3(a) Plasma
state of matter. The Sun and the most of other stars are in plasma state. Plasma is
also found in plasma TV and in gas discharge tubes (Fig. 7.3-b):when electric
current passes through them. The plasma state also occurs\during the early
stages of lightning formation known as lightning streamers which are the
conducting paths through the atmosphere due to ionizedair molecules.

m ture and Heat
When we touchice,cwe feel cold. When we dip , Ice cubes
our fingersin warm water, wé feel hot. Thus, by sense of
touch we can tell which of the bodiesis colder or hotter.
A hotter body is said to be at higher temperature as
compared to acolder body.
Itis our common experience that when we heat a
body, its temperature rises. Process of heating provides
heat or thermal energy to the body which is the cause Warm water
of the rise in temperature. Fig. 7.4
The following activity will help to define temperature.

Do they observe

of the was
Temperature can be defined as a physical quantity which
determines the direction of flow of thermal energy.
This means that thermal energy is transferred from one object to another
due to temperature difference of the two bodies. Therefore, we can define heat
as follows:
Heat is the energy which is transferred from one object to another due to
difference of temperature between the two bodies.
We know that matter is composed
of molecules which are always in
motion. Molecules of a solid are
vibrating about their fixed positions.
The molecules of a liquid are sliding
one over the other and those of gases
are randomly moving. The molecules aw & i: ‘
possess kinetic energy on account-of Fig. 7.5 The internal energy of air

their attractive forces.
The solide and potential energies of the
molecu of an object is called its internal energy.
When we heat a substance, its molecular motion becomes more vigorous
which means-an increase in its internal energy. As a result, temperature of the
substance rises. The heat energy transferred to a body increases the internal
energy of its molecules due to which its temperature rises.
Remember that, it is not true to say that a substance contains heat. The
substance contains internal energy. The word heat is used only when referring to
the energy actually in transit from hot to cold body.
7.3 Thermometers
Our sense of touch can tell us whether an object is hot or cold. It gives an
idea about the object's temperature but we cannot measure the actual
— —————

temperature of the body just by touching it. For the exact measurement of the
hotness ofa substance, we require an instrument called a thermometer.
Thermometers use some property of a substance, which changes
appreciably
with the change of temperature.
Basic Thermometric Properties
Some basic thermometric properties for a material suitable to construct
a thermometer are the following:
1 Itis a good conductor of heat.
2. It gives quick response to temperature changes.
3 It has uniform thermal expansion.
4. Ithas high boiling point.
5. It has low freezing point.
6. It has large expansivity (low specific heat capacity).
7. It does not wet glass.
8. It does not vapourize.
9. Itis visible.
Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer
We know that liquids expand on heating. So, expansion in the volume of a
liquid can be used for the measurement of temperature. This is known as
liquid-in-glass thermometer. One such liquid which is commonly used in
thermometers is mercury. Figure 7.6shows a mercury thermometer. It is made of
glass. It has a bulb at one end filled with mercury.
Capillary tube
Mercu ear scale
Measured temperature = 38°C

Wher'the temperature rises, the mercury expands and moves up through
the narrow capillary tube in the form ofa mercury thread. As shown in Fig. 7.6, the
position of the end of thread reads the temperature. Mercury is opaque and can
be easily seen due to its silvery colour. Alcohol is also a choice for the
thermometric liquid, but it must be coloured to make it visible.
Point to Ponder! Brain Teaser!
Could we make mercury (a) Why the walls of the
thermometer if expansion thermometer bulb are thin?
of glass would have been (b) Why the inner bore must be
greater than mercury? narrow?

Temperature Scales
For the measurement of temperature, a
scale is to be constructed which requires two
reference temperatures called two fixed points.
One is the steam point slightly above the
boiling of water at standard atmospheric
pressure. This corresponds to upper fixed point
of the scale. The second fixed point is the
melting point of pure ice or simply ice point. It is
called the lower fixed point. Different scales of
temperature have been constructed by
assigning different numerical values to these
fixed points. Three different scales are:
(i) Celsius or centigrade scale
(ii) Fahrenheit scale
(iii) Kelvinscale
In Celsius or centigrade scale, the
numerical values assigned to lower and_upper
fixed points are 0 and 100, As the difference
between these values is 100, so,-the space
between these points is divided into 100 equal
parts. Each part is knownas 1°C.
In Fahrenheit scale, the lower fixed point
is labelled as 32 and. Gpper as 212. As the
difference between these two numbers is 180,
so in this scale the space between these points
is divided into.180 equal parts. Each part is
known as 1°F, Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are
generally used in ordinary life.
There is a third scale of temperature
known as Kelvin scale or Absolute temperature
scale. It is used in scientific measurements. In
Kelvin scale, the lower and upper fixed points
are labelled as 273 and 373. As the difference
between these values is 100, so the width of 1 K
is the same as that of 1°C. The zero point of this
scale is the temperature at which the molecules

in gas thermometers. The resistance

known as absolute zero. Its value is -273.15 °C. For calculations, it is simply taken
as -273 °C. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature ever to be in the
whole universe. The matter does not exist below absolute zero temperature.

Thermocouple Thermometer
This type of thermometer consists of two wires of different materials such
er

as copper and iron. Their ends are joined together to
form two junctions. If the two junctions are at different Thermo-electric currentis
temperatures, a small current flows across them. This Pea
current is due to the potential difference produced
across the twojunctions as the two wires Thermocouple
have different resistance to the flow of | Hot Metal A Voltage
current. The greater is the difference of a ~
temperatures, the greater is the potential & re
difference or voltage produced across MetlE: cold junction
the junctions. If one end of the junction is Fig. 7.8
kept at a fixed lower temperature, say by placing it in an ice‘bath at 0°C for
reference, the temperature of other junction at a higher temperature can be
measured using a millivolt meter bya calibrated scale on it(Fig:7.8).
This type of thermometer is particularly useful for'very high temperatures
and also rapidly changing temperature as there is only a small mass of metal
(the junction) to heat up.
7.4 Sensitivity, Range and Linearity of Thermometers
A thermometer is evaluated by its*three key characteristics that are
sensitivity, range and linearity. They help determine the suitability of the
thermometer for specific use ensuring accurate and reliable measurement of
temperature.
Sensitivity
Sensitivity of a thermometer refers to its ability to detect small changes in
the temperature ofan object. For example, the minimum division on the scale of
a thermometeris.1°C. The accuracy of its temperature measurement will be 1°C.
On another thermometer the marks are 0,1°C apart. Hence, its accuracy will be
up to 0.1°C and said to be more sensitive. Its measurement will be more precise
than the measurement bya thermometer
with an accuracy of 1°C.
Range
This refers to the span of temperature, from low to high, over which the
thermometer can measure accurately. For example, a clinical thermometer
designed for human body temperature has a narrow or shart range, say from
35°C to 45°C. A long-range thermometer is usually used for science experiments
in the laboratory with markings from —10°C to 110°C. The choice of liquid for
— —

thermometers put a lower and upper limit for the range of a thermometer. For
example, Mercury freezes at -39°C and boils at 357°C. Hence, we can construct
mercury in glass thermometers within this range. The marking scale depends on
desired range of measurement. For extremely low temperatures, alcohol is used.
Alcohol has a much lower freezing point about -112°C which increases its lower
limit for the range but it has lower upper limit as it boils at 78 °C.
Linearity
This refers to a direct proportional relationship between the temperature
and scale reading across entire range of measurement. A good linear
thermometer should measure equal increments on the scale corresponding to
equal change in the temperature. It means that marking on the’scale should be
evenly spaced over the whole range. High linearity means more consistent and
proportional scale readings over the entire range to ensure accuracy of
measurement.
7.5 Structure of a Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer
A liquid-in-glass thermometer has,a narrow and uniform capillary tube
having a small bulb filled with mercury oralechol at its lower end. The thin wall of
the glass bulb allows quick conduction'through glass to the liquid from a hot
object whose temperature is to be méasured. Mercury being metal is a good
conductor and hence responds quickly to the change in temperature. The small
amount of liquid also responds’more quickly to a change in temperature. The
quick response makes the(device sensitive. Use of mercury is quite sensitive for
normal measurements.“For greater accuracy, alcohol can be used as its
expansivity is six times more than mercury but it has range limitation to higher
temperature measurements due to its low boiling point (78°C).
The uniformity of the narrow tube or bore ensures even expansion of the
liquid required to make the linear measuring scale. The choice of mercury allows
to use it over a long-range temperature due to its low freezing point and high
boiling point. It provides a fairly long range of measurement of temperature.

Magnetic Materials
Magnetism is a force that acts at a distance upon magnetic materials.
These materials are attracted to magnets. These materials are called magnetic
materials. Let us perform an activity to test such materials.
The teacher should divide the students into
groups and provide them permanent magnets to
perform this activity.
Each group should collect some items made
of different materials such as copper wire, nickel ring,
glass bottle, paper clips, iron nail, eraser, wooden
tuler, plastic comb, etc. Place them ona table as shown
in figure. Bring the permanent magnet close to each
item one by one and observe which items are
attracted by the magnet and which are not. Make a list of magne
materials. a4)
Materials such as iron, nickel and cobalt will beattra ted by the magnet. They are
magnetic materials. The materials such as brass, copper.)wood, glass and plastic are not
attracted by the magnet. They are called non--magneti¢ materials.
We will discuss different types of materialsin detail later in this chapter.

Over 1000 years ago, the Greeks Tedd a rock called lodestone or
magnetite that could attract al es containediron. Also, if suspended
from a string to rotate freely, it jis always settle in north-south direction.

You must have seen the iron filings following the movement of the
magnet. Magnetic force accounts for these movements. This activity
also shows that magnets can attract objects containing iron, etc. even if
they are not in direct contact with them.

8.2 Properties of Magnets
The property of attracting magnetic materials by the magnets has been
discussed above. The magnets also exhibit the following properties.
1. Magnetic Poles
If a bar magnet is suspended
horizontally through a string and allowed to
come to rest, it will point in north-south
direction. The end of the magnet that points
north is called the north magnetic pole (N)
and rhe end that points south is the south
magnetic pole (S) as shown in Fig. 8.1.
When two freely suspended bar magnets aré. ee j i

attract (Fig. 8.4 & Fig. 8.5). We-cary say that Like Fig: 82 P
poles repel and unlike poles attract. qe . wx)
3 . Identification ofa, Magnet Zn aa
To identify whether an object is a magnet or ai
simply a magnetic¢’material, we can bring its one end ae
close to any-polé of a suspended bar magnet. If it is a “ae
attracted, then we can conclude that the end of the Fig'€5
object is either of opposite pole to that of the
suspended magnet or it is simplya magnetic material. Then we should bring the
same end of the object close to the other end of the suspended magnet. If the
object is again attracted, it is not a magnet but it is a magnetic material.
If it is repelled by the other end of the suspended magnet, then the object is a
magnet.
The repulsion between the like poles
is
a real test
to identify a magnet.

4. |s Isolated Magnetic Pole Possible?
If we break a bar magnet into two equal
pieces, can we get N-pole and S-pole separately? {ii
No, it is not possible. Each piece will have its two
poles, i.e, N-pole and S-pole. Even if a magnet is Iv Sly sly Bln BS
divided into thousands pieces, each piece will be a Fig. 8.6
complete magnet with its N, and S-poles (Fig.8.6).
Magnetic material such as iron or steel can be made a magnet. This is
known as magnetization. In other words, we can say that magnetisnvhas induced
init. You can perform an activity to observe this fact.
The teacher should facilitate each group to performthisgcy $ perinstructions.
1, Take a magnetic compass. Put it on a table and see which.end of its needle points north.
The N-pole of the needle is usually coloured red.
2. Place a bar magnet on the table. Bring the compass 2. to its N-pole. In which direction
does the N-pole
of the needle stay? .
‘en
“
3. Putthe compass neartotheS-pole ofthe bar magnet. In which direction does the N-pole
of the needle stay thi: ~~
4. Nowplace an ironna head in contact with any pole of the bar magnet.
5. Putthe compass near to the pointed end of an iron nail. Observe the direction in which
N-pole of the needle settles. Has the nail become a magnet? Has magnetism been
induced init?
6. Take the bar magnet
away from the nail. Again check the behaviour of the nail by bringing
compass near to its ends. Does the magnetism vanish?
From the above activity, we conclude that the S-pole of the true magnet induces N-pole
in the near end of the piece of iron (nail) while the far end of the iron piece becomes
S-pole as shown in the figure.
It should be noted that the induced magnetism vanishes as the true magnet is
removed.
164

8.4 Tempo and Permanent Magnets
Temporary magnets are the magnets that work in the presence of a
magnetic field of permanent magnets. Once the magnetic field vanishes, they
lose their magnetic properties. You have learnt something about a magnetic field
in lower classes. In this chapter, we will study it in detail.
Usually, soft iron is used to make temporary magnets. Paper clips, office
pins and iron nails can easily be made temporary magnets. Electromagnets are
also good examples of temporary magnets. You have already learnt different
uses of electromagnets.
Permanent magnets retain their magnetic properties forever. These are
either found in nature or artificially made by placing objects madé of steel and
some special alloys in a strong magnetic field for a sufficient'time. There are
many types of permanent magnetic materials. For example cobalt, alnico and
ferrite.
The teacher should facilitate the aréups to
provide each a bar magnet, a stand with clanip, “some
small nails made of iron and also some nails of'steel. He
should further supervise them to perforra thé activity as
perinstructions. rex
1. Clamp the bar magnet horizentallyon the stand.
2. Touch the head of an iron mailto anyone end of the
magnet. It will be attracted and stick to the magnet.
Touch another iran nail'té the lower end of the first
one, doesit stick toit?
Yes, it will, becausé the upper nail has become a
magnet itself\Go on hanging iron nail one by one to
makea chain until no mare nails stay attached to the
chain.
3. Try to hang steel nails at the other end of the bar
magnet
to forma similar chain.
Remove the chain of iron nails by pulling the topmost nail. Does the chain collapse?
Remove the chain of steel nails in the same way. Does this collapse?
You will observe that the chain of iron nails immediately collapses but the steel nails
remain attached to each other for some time. This shows that the magnetism induced in
the iron nails is temporary while thatin the steel nails is permanent.

8.5 Magnetic Fields
When a magnet attracts a certain magnetic
material, it exerts some force to do so. Similarly, when it _
attracts or repels a magnetic pole of another magnet, it =
exerts a force on it. This force can be observed up to a
certain distance from the magnet that can be explained
by the concept of magnetic field around the magnet.
A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where
an other magnetic object experiences a force on it.
The pattern of a magnetic field around a bar
magnet can be seen very easily by a simple experiment. Fig. a7
If iron filings are sprinkled on a thin glass plate'placed overa bar magnet,
the filings become tiny magnets through magnetic induction. Now if the glass
surface is gently tapped, the filings form a pattérn. This pattern is known as the
magnetic field pattern (Fig.8.7). This pattern,can be better shown by lines that
correspond to the path of the filings. Thesé lines are called magnetic lines of
force.
Magnetic lines
of Force
The magnetic lines offorce around X mee
a bar magnet can be drawn by using a
small compass. The needle of the compass
will move along the magnetic lines of force. TF
ar an
Figure. 8.8 shows the magnetic lines of
force around.a bar magnet drawn by this
method. The compass needle is
symbolized by an arrow being the north
pole (Fig. 8.9).
The magnetic field at a point has both
amagnitude anda direction.
_. Fie 8.8
The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space
is the direction indicated by the N-pole of a magnetic
compass needle placed at that point.

Figure. 8.8 also shows that the field lines appear to originate from the
north pole and end on the south pole. Actually, the magnetic field extends in
space all around the magnet but the figure shows the field in one plane only.
Strength
of the Magnetic Field
The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the number of
magnetic lines of force passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the
lines. Thus, the magnetic field is stronger in regions where the field lines are
relatively close together and weaker where these are far apart. For example in
Fig. 8.10, the lines are closest together near north and south poles indicating that
the strength of the magnetic field is stronger in these regions. Away from the
poles, the magnetic field becomes weaker.
1 Se
Fig. 8.10 Fig. 8.11 Fig. 8.12
In case the two magnets are placed close to each other, their combined
magnetic field can also be drawn.byusing the compass needle. Figure. 8.10 and
Fig. 8.11 show the patterns ofthe combined magnetic field of two magnets
lying with different orientations. In Fig. 8.11, point 'x' is called a neutral point
because the field due to.one magnet cancels out that due to the other magnet.
Figure. 8.12 represents, the field pattern of a horse-shoe magnet. The field is
almost uniform between the poles except near the edges.
8.6 Uses of Permanent Magnets
There are many uses of permanent magnets suchas:
They are the essential parts of D.C motors, A.C and D.C electric generators.
Permanent magnets are used in the moving coil loud-speakers.
These are very commonly used in door catchers.
Magnetic strips are fitted to the doors of refrigerators and freezers to
keep the door closed tightly.
5. They are commonly used to separate iron objects from different mixtures.
Flourmills use permanent magnets to remove iron nails, etc. from the
grains before grinding.

6. In the medical field, they are used to remove iron splinters from the eyes.
% A piece of permanent magnet is used to reset the iron pointer in a
maximum and minimum thermometer.

produce sound in the air.
8.7 Electromagnets
Electromagnets are also a kind of temporary magnets. The following
activity will show how electromagnets can be made and tested.

The teacher should divide the students into groups and facilitate them
to perform this activity.
Iron
Take a battery of two cells, a Thread Nail
switch, an iron nail, cotton (or
plastic) covered copper wire, thread
and a few paper clips. I
Wind the wire over the iron |
nail to form a coil. Suspend the coil i
by means of thread tied to its centre. |
Connect ends of the wire to the
battery through the switch as shown
inthe figure.
Keeping the switch OFF, bring some paperclipsnear to one end of the
nail. Do they stick to the nail? Now turn the switch ON and again bring the
paper clips near to the end of the nail. Do they stick this time? Does the nail
behave like a magnet? Yes, the nail has beCome a magnet. Turn the switch OFF
and see what happens to the clips. Dsthey fall down? What do you conclude
from this activity?
An iron nail or a rod be ines aae when an electric current
passes througha oiearoundit. Itis called an electromagnet.
When an electric Current passes through the coil of wire, magnetic field is
produced inside the coibthat magnetizes the iron nail. As we have observed that
the magnetic properties of an electromagnet are temporary, therefore, iron
object remains.a magnet as long as the electric current passes through the coil.
When the currentis stopped, it no longer remains a magnet.
If we increase the number of cells in the battery or increase the number of
turns of the coil, we will observe that the strength of the magnetic field in each
case increases. This will be indicated by the more number of clips held by the nail
in these cases.
Uses of Electromagnets
Electromagnets are used in electric bell, telephone receiver, simple
magnetic relay, circuit breaker, reed switches, cranes, tape recorder, maglev
trains and many other devices. Functions of some of them are described below:

This is a type of switch which works with an electromagnet. It is an input
circuit which works with a low current for safety purpose. When it is turned ON it
activates another circuit which works with a high current.
The input circuit supplies a small current to electromagnet. It attracts the
iron armature which is pivoted. The other end of the armature moves up and
pushes the metal contacts to join together which turn the high current-circuit
ON (Fig.8.15).

Telephone Receiver Electromagnet
There is an iron diaphragm in the
receiver under which an electromagnet is
placed (Fig.8.17). The microphone of the
telephone handset on the other side sends
varying electric current in accordance with the
sound signals. When the varying current
passes through the coil of receiver on this

side, it causes variation in the force of Fig. 8.17
electromagnet. As a result, the diaphragm over it moves back and forth to
produce sound.
For Your Information!
A wonderful use of
electromagnets can be seen in the
Maglev trains. The maglev stands fora
magnetically levitated train. A maglev “4

Electromagnetic Cranes
Huge electromagnets are used in
cranes at scrapyards, steel works and on
ships. These are so powerful that they can
lift iron and steel objects such as cars as
shown in Fig.8.18. After moving the heavy
objects to the required position, the
objects are released byjust switching OFF
the current of the electromagnet.

8.8 Domain Theory of Magnetism
It is observed that the magnetic Sanaay
field of a bar magnet is like the field
produced bya solenoid (long coil of wire)
carrying current (Fig. 8.19-a & b). It AN
suggests that all magnetic effects are due
to moving charges. In case of solenoid,
charges are moving in the wire. The wr TMSi> — Ce
motion responsible forthe magnetismina N wags
magnet is due to electrons within the | wu a VATA
atoms of the material. _ (Current
We know that an electron is a Fig. €:19(b)
charged particle. Also, each electron in an atom is revolving about the nucleus
and atthe same time, itis spinning about an axis through it. The rotation and spin
both give rise to a magnetic field. Since there are many electrons in an atom, their
rotations and spins may be so oriented to,stréngthen the magnetic effects
mutually or to cancel the effects of one another. If an atom has some resultant
magnetic field, it behaves like a tiny magnet-It is called a magnetic dipole.
Fig. 8.19{a)
Paramagnetic Materials
If the orbital and spin axes.of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that
their fields support one another and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet, the
materials with such atoms are called paramagnetic materials, such as aluminium
and lithium.
Diamagnetic Materials
Magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the
electrons in an atom may add up to zero. In this case, the atom has no resultant
field. The materials with such atoms are called diamagnetic materials, Some of
their examples are copper, bismuth, water, etc.
Ferromagnetic Materials
There are some solid substances such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. in
which cancellation of any type does not occur for large groups of neighbouring
atoms of the order of 10°° because they have electron spins that are naturally
aligned parallel to each other. These are known as ferromagnetic materials.
172

The group of atoms in this type of material form a region of about 0.1 mm
size that is highly magnetized. This region is called a magnetic domain. Each
domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles.
Alignment of Domains
The domains in a ferromagnetic material are
randomly oriented as shown in Fig.8.20 (a). The magnetic
fields of the domains cancel each other so the material
does not display any magnetism. However, an
unmagnetized piece of iron can be magnetized by
placing it in an external magnetic field provided by a
permanent magnet or an electromagnet.
The external magnetic field penetrates the Fig. 8.20(b)
unmagnetized iron and induces magnetism in it by causing two effects on the
domains. Those domains whose magnetism is parallebor nearly parallel to the
external magnetic field grow in size at the expense of.other domains that are not
oriented. In addition, the magnetic alignment of the other domains rotates and
become oriented in the direction of the extemal field (Fig.8.20-b). As a result, the
iron is magnetized and behaves like a magnet having its own north and south
poles. For Your Information!
In soft iron, the domains are‘easily oriented on ae Seciulewt

used to make permanent magnets. electromagnets are made
In non=ferromagnetic materials, such as byusing
cores of softiron of
aluminium and copper, the formation of magnetic Se a ferromagnetic
domains does not occur, so magnetism cannot be a
induced into these substances.
8.9 Magnetisation and Demagnetisation
There are two methods used for magnetising a steel bar:
1. Stroking
In this method, magnetism is induced in a steel bar by using the magnetic
field of a permanent magnet. The steel bar can be stroked in two ways:
173
Fig. 8.20(a)

(a) Single-Touch Method
Asteel bar is placed on a horizontal surface. It is
stroked from one end to the other several times
in the same direction using the same pole (say
N) of the permanent magnet. Every time the
magnet is lifted up sufficiently high on reaching
the other end of the bar (Fig. 8.21).
(b) Double-Touch Method
In this method, stroking is done fram the
centre of the steel bar onwards with the unlike
poles of two permanent magnets at the same
time (Fig. 8.22). This method is more efficient
than the first one,
In both the cases, the poles produced at the ends
of magnetized steel bar after stroking are of the
opposite polarity
to that of the stroking pole.
2. Making a Magnet using Solenoid
In this method, a steel bar_to jbe
magnetised is placed inside a solenoid (long coil
of wire) as shown in Fig. 8.23. The\solenoid
should have several hundred turns of insulated
copper wire. When direct.cdrrent is passed
Current oe Current
Fig. 8.23
through the solenoid, the-steel bar becomes a magnet. The polarity of the
magnetised steel bar is’found by applying Right hand Grip rule which is
stated as:
GriI are with the right hand such that fingers
curled along the direction of current (positive to the
ae terminal of the battery) in the solenoid, then
the thumb points
to the N-pole of the bar end.
Demagnetisation of Magnets
1. Heating
Thermal vibrations tend to disturb the order of the ®
domain. Therefore, if we heat a magnet strongly, the magnet
Fig. 8.24
loses its magnetism very quickly (Fig. 8.24).
174

2. Hammering
If we beat a magnet, the domains lose their
alignment and the magnet is demagnetised. It is also Ss
called hammering (Fig. 8.25).
aig ) Fig. 8.25
3. Alternating Current >
When an alternating current (A.C) is flowing
through a long solenoid, a magnet moved out slowly
from inside of the solenoid is demagnetised (Fig. 8.26). Fig 826
8.10 Applications of Magnets in Recording Technology
Electromagnets have widely used in recording»technology of sound,
video and data in the form of electrical signals throligh magnetization of a
magnetic material. Most common magnetic recording mediums are magnetic
tapes and disk recorders which are used not only;to reproduce audio and video
signals but also to store computer data. These.materials are usually coated with
iron oxide. Some other recordings mediums are magnetic drums, ferrite cores
and magnetic bubble memory. We will discuss the process of magnetic
recording on tapes and disks in some detail.
Magnetic Tape Recording,
Induced magnetism~is used in the
process of magnetic-tape recording. ,-
Recording and playing head is a coil of wire
wrapped around.én iron core. The iron core

has a horse-shoe shape with a narrow gap in 7" | head
between its two ends. Audio and video tapes vee pe

ferromagnetic material. ; ; Plastic backing TM Fringe field penetrates
Sound or picture is converted into magnetic coating
electrical forms as varying currents. These
currents are sent to the head that becomes an i Pe a
si ae J
electromagnet with a N-pole at one end and Sohn ¢
a S-pole at the other end, The magnetic field Induced
magnetism
lines pass through the iron core and cross the Fig. 8.27
175

gap. Some of the field lines in the gap curved outward as shown in Fig. 8.27. The
curved part of the magnetic field called as fringe field penetrates magnetic
coating on the moving tape and induces magnetism in the coating. This induced
magnetism is retained when the tape leaves the vicinity of the recording head.
The reverse process changes the varying induced magnetism into varying
current that onward is converted into sound or picture.
Hard Disk Recording
Hard disks are circular flat plates
made of aluminium, glass or plastic and
coated on both sides with iron oxide. Hard
disks can store terabyte of information.
A magnetic head is a small
electromagnet which writes a binary digit
(1 or 0) by magnetising tiny spots on the
spinning disk in different directions and
reads digit by detecting the magnetisation
direction of spots (Fig. 8.28). The term hard
disk is also used to refer to the whole of a Fig. 8.28
computer's internal data storage.
Magnetic disk devices have an advantage over tapes recorders. A disk unit
has the ability to read or write.a recording instantly while locating a desired
information on tape may take many minutes.
Electronic devices»can be protected from strong magnetic effects by
enclosing them in the-boxes made of soft iron. We will describe it in detail in the
next section.
8.11 Soft iron as Magnetic Shield Soften
Soft iron has high magnetic (FS
permeability. The permeability is the ability {2
of a material to allow the magnetic flux or
lines of force through it when the material is
placed inside a magnetic field. When a piece
of soft iron is put into a magnetic field, it
generates a magnetic field due to
magnetisation.
Voice coil
positioner
External magnetic field
Fig. 8.29
176

If a sensitive magnetic device is enclosed in a casing of soft iron, the
magnetic flux gets established in the soft iron rather than the device. Thus, the
device is shielded from external magnetic field.
Figure 8.29 can explain this phenomenon well. A soft iron casing (shell) is
placed inside a magnetic field produced by opposite poles of two bar magnets.
Since the magnetic permeability of the iron shell is higher than that of air, so the
magnetic flux is established in the soft iron. As a result, the device is protected
from the magnetic field. Usually, the casing is made with rounded corners to
facilitate the magnetic field line
up easily.
Soft iron is generally used in the cores of transformers and
electromagnets because of its high permeability. In case of anvelectromagnet,
the core of soft iron can be easily magnetised when current is passed around it
and quickly lost when current is stopped. That is why, electromagnets are widely
used in electric bells, loud speakers, picking and releasing iron scraps by the
cranes and in many more appliances. The sensitivity of a moving coil
galvanometer is also increased by placing a soft iron core inside the coil.

Science is a collective knowledge about the natural phenomena, processes and
events occurring around us. The process starts with asking a question, how and
why the things in the world behave as such. We try to look orderliness and
regularities among various phenomena apparently of diverse nature. Such study
of nature gave birth to a single discipline, known as Natural Philosophy now
known as science. There was a tremendous increase in the volume of scientific
knowledge at the beginning of nineteenth century. That made it necessary to
classify the study of nature basically into two main disciplines.
(0) The biological sciences which deal with the living things.
(i) = The physical sciences which are about the study of non-living things.
Physics is an important and basic part of physical sciences_beside other
disciplines such as chemistry and geology.
9.1 Scope of Physics
Physics is the fundamental science that deals
with the constituents of the universe, that is, matter,
energy, space, time and their mutual relationships and
interactions. It strives to understand howthe ‘universe
works, from the smallest subatomic particles to the
largest star and galaxies, We have studied some of the
basic properties of matter, energy_and their mutual This toy which worked by

The time measures the sequence and durations of events. It is considered
fourth dimension. For example, oscillating motion such as that of a swinging
pendulum relies on the time interval that determines frequency of oscillations.
Another example is the time dilation which is a phenomenon discussed by
special theory of relativity where time passes slowly for an observer moving at
ultra-high speed compared to one relatively at rest. Physics explores how these
fundamental concepts are inter-connected. For example, the theory of relativity
explains how space and time are not absolute quantities but are related to each
other. It describes the relationship between space and time and how they are
influenced by gravity and speed, for example, the bending of light around

massive objects like stars. Another branch of physics, the quantum mechanic,
explains the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is how
the physics has applied its principles to wide variety of phenomena, from
everyday occurrences such as related to motion and heat to the extreme
conditions found in the universe.
9.2 Branches of Physics
Due to expanding scope of research in Physics, it is usually divided into
the following branches?

Interdisciplinary Research
Collaboration and interdisciplinary nature of science is essential for
addressing the complexissues and challenges of today. By working together and
sharing knowledge, scientists can achieve more significant breakthrough and
contribute to a deeper understanding of the natural and physical world around
us. It allowssus~to contribute to advance in technology, healthcare,
environmental issues and many other areas. We need collaborated efforts
because:
(1) ~~ Solution of complex issues requires multifacet expertise
Many challenging issues, such as climate change, disease prevention and
treatment, sustainable energy solution are of diverse nature. It is difficult for one
discipline to address them adequately. Such as understanding and mitigating
climate change require knowledge for meteorology, oceanography, physics,
chemistry, biological and environmental sciences. Similarly, the health care
issues such as recent Covid epidemic involved combined efforts of expertise

from biology, chemistry, physics, medical technologies and data science to
combat this challenge.
(ii). _ Interdisciplinary
approaches foster innovation
Combined different perspectives and methodologies evolve innovation
or out of box solutions. This approach can lead to novel insight and
breakthroughs that might not emerge working in isolation. For example, nano-
technology is a blend of physics, chemistry, material science and engineering to
create materials and devices at the nano-scale with unique applications in
medical, energy and electronics. In an other field of “artificial intelligence” the
development involves computer science, mathematical logic, neuroscience, etc.
The collaboration across these fields enhanced the development of intelligence
systems and their applications.
(iii). Rapid sharing of knowledge and information across the globe
Sharing and collaboration of knowledge across*the globe brings rapid
advances in science. The online internet information“exchanges, conferences
and workshops provide platforms bringing together researchers from different
fields to share their fresh findings, discussion and brainstorming new
approaches. Collaborated research projects and research journals are also
means of collaborate research.
Interdisciplinary research and ‘collaboration lead to a more holistic
understanding of challenging isstes by interacting with different perspectives
suchas that of environment and-space exploration.
9.5 Scientific Method
Scientific method is a systematic approach used to search for truth of an
issue and problemysolving regarding natural and physical world. It is based on
the followingsteps:
1. Identify or recognize an issue ora problem.
2. Gather information through observations of its various aspects.
3. Propose an explanation ora guess work known as hypothesis.
4 Perform experiment or collect evidences to test the hypothesis.
5. Record, organize and analyze gathered data, plotting and interpreting
graphs to reach ata conclusion which is called a theory.
6. Repeated tests of the theory to wide range of similar issues then lead
towards the formulation ofa law.
Some key steps are elaborated here:
— ————

1. Observation
The first step in scientific method is
to make observations of natural processes
and to collect the data about them. This
may be done either by ordinary
observations or by obtaining the results
from different experiments. For example, it
is our common observation that shadow of
an opaque object is formed when it is
placed in the path of light coming from the
Sunoralamp (Fig.9.1). Fig,.9:1
2. Hypothesis
On the basis of the data collected through observations or
experimentation, we can develop a hypothesis. This is‘done in order to test its
logical results i.e. it is assumed that nature will-act in a particular way under
certain specific circumstances. From the.“aboVe example, we assume that
shadows of opaque objects are formed.when they come in the path of light
because light travels in a straight line.
3. Experiment
Experiment is an organized repeatable process which is used to test the
truth ofa hypothesis.
To verify the assumption made in the above example, four cardboards,
each with a hole, are placed in a straight line, such that the hole in 1* card _ is in
front of a torch, When we see through the hole in cards, we can see the light of
the torch (Fig-9,2-a). If any of these cards is displaced, we cannot see light
passing through (Fig. 9.2-b). Thus, this experiment proves that light travels in a
straight line.

4.Theory

After the successful verification
of an assumption and with the help of J
careful experimentation, it becomes a Hypothesis

phenomena. With the help of the

straight line. So, it then becomes a Theory

It is a logical explanation of the J
causes and effects of an issue or an Prediction
event that occurs in nature. T Negative
Positive | result

5. Prediction
After the careful analysis of a theory, we can make predictions about
certain unknown aspects of nature-To verify the prediction, experiments are
designed to test the theory over.and over again. If test result do not agree,
hypothesis is changed or rejected.
6. Falsifiability,
It is atconcept introduced that suggests a theory
to be considered scientific if it also make predictions
that can be tested and potentially proven false. The §
requirement of falsifiability ensures that theories are not
based on vague, non-specific or untestable claims. It
In the 20" century, Albert
Einstein declared that
distinguishes scientific theories from false or pretended mass and energy, the
beliefs that cannot be experimentally tested. two concerns of Physics,

His theory of relativity
altered man's views of
the universe.
ee

7. Law
When a theory has been tested many times and generally accepted as
true, it is called a law. The law is such a statement regarding the behaviour of
nature which explains the observations and experiments of the past and can
predict about other aspects of nature. From the fact that light travels in a straight
line, we can predict that shadow of an opaque object, similar in shape, is formed
whenever it is placed in the path of light. For example, the shadow of a ball will be
round whereas the shadow of a rectangular block will be a rectangle. After
testing the theory under different situations, this becomes a law of science that
light travels in a straight line.
The theories or laws of Physics are man-made ideas about the way the
things work. They are liable to be disproved or modified withthe future advances
in science which brings fresh facts and new insights about the natural and
physical world.
9.6 Scientific Base of Technologies and Engineering
Science or to be more specific, Physics plays a vital role being the core of
each invention based on physical laws‘and principles. Technology refers to the
methods and techniques developed by using scientific knowledge. It may be a
machine technology or a software programme of information technology. For
example,
(i) Automobile technology is based on the principles of the
thermodynamics,
(ii) Radar technology is based on the detection and reflection principles of
electromagnetic waves.
(iii) Laser technology is based on the principles of atomic physics. It is widely
used in medical diagnosis and treatment, metallurgy, industry,
telecommunication and space exploration.
Engineering is the process of applying various technologies and scientific
principles to design various instruments, tools and build things that help to meet
specific needs in every walk of life. Engineers also consider factors like cost
effectiveness and safety measures when designing various products. Examples
include:
(i) A civil engineer designs a bridge that can withstand strong winds,
earthquakes, intense weather conditions and heavy traffic.
— —

(ii) Asoftware engineer designs a user friendly application of a smartphone.
(iii) An aviation engineer looks for lighter material which can withstand
sudden and severe disturbances and extreme weather conditions during
the flight ofan aeroplane,
Though the science, technology and engineering fields seem distinct but
they often work together. Scientific discoveries lead to new technologies and
engineers rely on scientific knowledge for our benefits and comforts. They are
the potent for change in the outlook of mankind in shaping life style and
influencing our way of thinking.
