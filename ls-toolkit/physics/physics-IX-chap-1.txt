         We  are  living  in  a  physical  world  where  we  observe  many  natural  
phenomena and objects around us such as Sun, stars, moon, oceans, plants,  
winds, rains, etc. People have always been curious to know the reality of such  
happenings. This has led certain people to investigate the facts and laws working  
in this world. This field of observation and experimentation to understand about  
the world around us is known as science. Everything in our lives is closely linked  
to science and the discoveries made by the scientists. In order to obtain reliable  
results from experiments, the primary thing is to make accurate measurements.  
         Physical quantities and their measurements have always been the matter  
of  interest  for  the  scientists.  They  have  been  investigating  to  improve  the  
methods and instruments for accurate measurements of the physical quantities.  
In  this  chapter,  we  will  discuss  physical  quantities,  their  measurements  and  
related contents.  

  

1.1 Physical and Non-Physical Quantities  

         We describe various natural phenomenon, events and human behaviour  
using some of their features and terms such as love, affection, fear, wisdom,  
beauty,  length, volume,  density, time, temperature, etc.  Some of these can  be  

measured  directly  and  indirectly  using  some  tools  and                          Quick Quiz  
instruments such as length of an object using a ruler, time                       Is a non-physical  
                                                                                    quantity has  
duration of an event using a clock, the temperature (the                            dimensions?  
degree  of  hotness)  of  somebody  using  a  thermometer.  

They are called physical quantities. The foundation of physics rests upon physical  
quantities through which the laws and principles of physics are expressed.  
         Other quantities quoted above such as love, affection, fear, wisdom, and  
beauty cannot be measured using tools and instruments. They often pertain to  
the  perception  or  interpretation  of  the  observer.  They  can  be  described  or

﻿qualitatively  or  compared  using  some  pre-determined  criteria,  indices  or  
through survey techniques. Non-physical quantities mostly help to understand  
and to analyse human behaviour, emotions and social interactions.

1.2 Base and Derived Physical Quantities  

             Physics  is  a  science  of  physical  world  where  we  interact  with  many  
different types of material objects. These objects are exposed in terms of their  
measurable  features  known  as  physical  quantities  such  as  length,  breadth,  
thickness,  mass,  volume,  density,  time,  temperature,  etc.  Out  of  these,  the  
scientists have selected arbitrarily some quantities to play a key role. They are  
called base quantities. All the quantities which can be described in terms of one  
or  more  base  quantities  are  called  derived  physical  quantities.  For  example,  
speed is a derived quantity which depends on distance and time which are base  
quantities  whereas  density  of  a  material  is  described  in  terms  of  mass  and  
volume.  

 Measurement of a Physical Quantity  
                                                                                             
             A measurement is a process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a  
widely accepted standard quantity.  

  

       Activity 1.1  

     The teacher should facilitate this activity and initiate discussion as per direction.  
     One student should measure the length of a writing board with his hand. The same should  
     be repeated by four or five students. Are all the measurements same?  If they differ, then  
     why? What is the solution to avoid confusion?  

                                                                         7  
﻿             In the early days people used to measure length using hand or arm, foot  
or  steps.  This  measurement  may  result  in  confusion  as  the  measurement  of  
different  people  may  differ  from  
each  other  because  of  different                                   
                                                                      
sizes of their hands, arms or steps.                                  
To avoid such confusion, there  is a     
need  of   a  standard   so  that                                     
measurement  by  any  person  may     
result the same. This standard of                                     
                                                                      
measurement is known as a unit.  
                                                                      
  

  A  measurement  consists  of  two

Not  very  far  in  the  past,  every                                 
country in the world had its own                                      
units  of  measurements.  However,                                    
                                                                            The International Prototype kilogram  
problems were faced when people  
of  different  countries  exchanged  scientific  information  or  traded  with  other  
countries using different units. Eventually, people got the idea of standardizing  
the units of measurements which could be used by all countries for efficient  
working and growth of mutual trade, business and share scientific information.

 SI Prefixes  

          The SI is a decimal system. Prefixes are used to write units by powers of 10.  
The big quantities like 50000000 m and small quantities like 0.00004 m are not  
convenient to write down. The use of prefixes makes them simple. The quantity  

                                                    7  
50000000 m can be written as 5 × 10 m. Similarly, the quantity 0.00004 m can be  

                        −5  
written as 4 ×  10         m.  
          Prefixes  are  the  words  or  symbols  added  before  SI  unit  such  as  milli,  
centi,  kilo,  mega,  giga  (Table1.4).  The  prefixes  given  in  Table  1.4  should  be  
known for use of SI units effectively. For example, one thousandth (1/1000) of  
a   metre   is   millimetre.   The   thickness   of   a   thin   wire   can   be   expressed  
conveniently in millimetres whereas a long distance is expressed in kilometres  
which is  1000 metres.  
          Multiples and sub-multiples of mass measurement are given in Table 1.5  
whereas  multiples  and  sub-multiples  of  length  are  given  in  Table  1.6.  The  
following examples will explain the meaning of prefixes.

Micrometer Screw Gauge  

          It is used to measure very small lengths such as diameter of a wire or  
thickness of a metal sheet. It has two scales:  
(a)      The main scale on the sleeve which has markings of 0.5 mm each.  
(b)      The   circular   scale   on   the   thimble   which   has   50   divisions.   Some  
          instruments may have main scale marking of 1 mm and 100 divisions on  
         the thimble.  
         When the thimble makes one complete turn, the spindle moves 0.5 mm  
(1 scale division) on the main scale which is called pitch of the screw gauge. Thus,  
its least count is:

  Physical Balance  
             There are many kinds of balances used    
                                                                                        
for  measuring  mass of an object.  In our daily    
life, we use the term weight instead of mass. In    
                                                                                        
Physics, they have different meanings. Mass is    
the measure of quantity of matter in a body    
                                                                                        
whereas the weight is the force by which the    
body  is  attracted  towards  the  Earth.  Weight    
                                                                                                          Fig.  1.8  
can  be   measured  using  spring  balance  
(Fig. 1.8). The mass of an object is found by    
comparing  it  with  known  standard  masses.    
                                                                                        
This process is called weighing. In laboratories,    
we  use  physical  balance  shown  in  Fig.  1.9    
                                                                                        
which is based on the principle of levers. The    
process of measurement is given below:

      screws until the plumb line is exactly above    
                                                                                                           Fig.  1.9  
      the pointed mark.  

2.   Turn the knob so that the pans of the balance are raised up. Is the beam  
       horizontal and pointer at the centre of the scale? If not, turn the balancing  
      screws on the beam so that it becomes horizontal.  
3.   Place the object to be weighed on the left pan.  
4.   Place the known weight from the weight box in the right pan using forceps.  
5.   Adjust the weight so that pointer remains on zero or oscillates equally on  
       both sides of the zero of the scale.  
6.   The total of standard masses (weights) is a measure of the mass of the object  
      in the left pan.

 Displacement Can Method  

            If the body does not fit into the measuring cylinder, then an overflow can  
or displacement can of wide opening is used as shown in Fig. 1.13. Place the  
displacement  can  on  the  horizontal  table.  Pour  water  in  it  until  it  starts  
overflowing through its opening. Now tie a piece of thread to the solid body and

﻿measurement  should  indicate  the  estimated  error  in  the  measured  values.  
Usually,  there   are  three   types   of  experimental   errors   affecting  the  
measurements.  
           (i) Human Errors    (ii) Systematic Errors     (iii) Random Errors  

  

 (i) Human Errors  

           They occur due to personal performance. The limitation of the human  
perception such as the inability to perfectly estimate the position of the pointer  
on a scale. Personal errors can also arise due to faulty procedure to read the scale.  
The correct measurement needs to line up your eye right in front of the level. In  
timing experiments, the reaction time of an individual to start or stop clock also  
affects the measured value. Human error can be reduced by ensuring proper  
training,  techniques  and  procedure  to  handle  the  instruments  and  avoiding  
environmental distraction or disturbance for proper focusing. The best way is to  
use automated or digital instruments to reduce the impact of human errors.  

  

(ii) Systematic Errors  

           They  refer  to  an  effect  that  influences  all  measurements  of  particular  
measurements equally. It produces a consistence difference in reading. It occurs  
due to some definite rule. It may occur due to zero error of instrument, poor  
calibration of instrument or incorrect marking. The effect of this kind of error can  
be reduced by comparing the instrument with another which is known to be  
more accurate. Thus, a correction factor can be applied.  

  

(iii) Random Errors

﻿1.10 Uncertainity in a Measurement  
                                                                                       
           There is no such thing as a perfect measurement. Whenever a physical  
quantity is measured except counting, there is inevitably some uncertainty about  
its determined value due to some instrument.  
                                                                                    Uncertainty in Digital  
This uncertainty may be due to use of a number                                             Instruments  
of reasons. One reason is the type of instrument                                  Some modern measuring  
being  used.  We  know  that  every  measuring                                instruments have a digital scale.  
instrument  is  calibrated  to  a  certain  smallest  
                                                                               We usually estimate one digit  
division and this fact puts a limit to the degree                               beyond what is certain. With  
of   accuracy   which   can   be   achieved   while                            digital scale, this is reflected in  
measuring  with  it.  Suppose  that  we  want  to                                fluctuation of the last digit.  
measure  the  length  of  a  straight  line with  the  
help of a metre rule calibrated in millimetres. Let the end point of the line lies  
between  10.3 cm and  10.4 cm marks. By convention, if the end of the line does  
not touch or cross the midpoint of the smallest division, the reading is confined  
to the previous division. In case the end of the line seems to be touching or have  
crossed the midpoint, the reading is extended to the next division. Thus, in this  
example, the maximum uncertainty is   ± 0.05 cm. It is, infact, equivalent to an  
uncertainty of 0.1 cm equal to the least count of the instrument divided into two  
parts, half above and half below the recorded reading.  
           The uncertainty in small length such as diameter of a wire and short  
interval of time can be reduced further by taking multiple readings and then  
finding average value. For example, the average time of one oscillation of a  
simple pendulum is usually found by measuring the time for thirty oscillations.  
           The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured quantity can be  
indicated conveniently by using significant figures.  

  

1.11 Significant Figures  
           We can count the number of candies in a jar and know it exactly by  
counting but we cannot measure the height of the jar exactly. All measurements  
include uncertainties depending upon the refinement of the instrument which is  
used for measurement.  
           It is important to reflect the degree of uncertainty in a measurement by  
recording the observation in significant figures.  

    The significant figures or digits are the digits of a                               
           measurement which are reliably known.                                        
           Figure  1.14  shows  a  rod  whose  length  is                               
measured with a ruler. The measurement shows the                                        
length in between 4.6 cm and 4.7 cm. Since the length                                             Fig. 1.14  

of the rod is slightly more than 4.6 cm but less than 4.7 cm, so the first student  
estimates it to be 4.6 cm whereas the second student takes it as 4.7 cm. The first  
student  thinks  that  the  edge  is  nearer  to  6  mm  mark  whereas  the  

                                                            20  
  
﻿ second student considers the edge of the rod nearer to 7 mm mark. It is difficult  
 to decide what is the true length.                                          Quick Quiz

 but the next digit is doubtful which has                    occuring  in  nature which could serve as

 been  determined  by  estimation  only  
 and has a probability of error. Therefore, it is known as a doubtful digit. In any  
 measurement,  the  accurately  known  digits  and  the  first  doubtful  digit  are  
 known-as significant figures.  
          The following points are to be kept in mind while determining the number  
 of significant figures in any data.  All digits from  1 to 9 are significant. However,  
 zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules apply:  
 (a) A zero between two digits is considered significant. For example in 5.06m, the  
      number of significant figures is 3.  
 (b) Zeros on the left side of the measured value are not significant. For example,  
      in 0.0034 m, the number of significant figures is 2.  
 (c) Zeros on the right side of a decimal are considered significant. For example, in  
      2.40 mm the significant digits are 3.  
 (d)  If numbers are recorded in scientific notation, then all the digits before the  
                                                                            4 
      exponent are significant. For example, in 3.50 ×  10 m, the significant figures  
      are 3.

 1.12 Precision and Accuracy  

          A physical measurements should be precise as well as accurate. These are  
 two  separate  concepts  and  need  clear  distinction.  Generally,  precision  of  a  
 measurement refers to how close together a group of measurements actually are  
 to each other. Accuracy of a measurement refers how close the measured value is  
 to some accepted or true value.

    Precise not accurate                    Accurate not precise                     Accurate and precise  
                                                   Fig. 1.15  

          A classic illustration is helpful to distinguish the two concepts.  Consider a  
target or bullseye hit by  arrows  in Fig. 1.15. To be precise, arrows must hit near  
each other (Fig.1.15-a)  and to  be  accurate, arrows must hit  near  the  bullseye  

                                                       21  
  
﻿(Fig.  1.15-b).  Consistently  hitting  near  the  centre  of  bullseye  indicates  both  
precision  and  accuracy  (Fig.  1.15-c).  When  these  concepts  are  applied  to  
measurements, the precision is determined by the instrument being used for  
measurement. The smaller the least count, the more precise is the measurement.  
A measurement is accurate if it correctly reflects the size of the object being  
measured.  Accuracy  depends  on  fractional  uncertainty  in  the  measurement.  
Infact, it is relative measurement which is important. The smaller the size of  
physical  quantity,  the  more  precise  instrument  is  needed  to  be  used.  The  
accuracy of measurement is reflected by the number of significant figures, the  
larger is the number of significant figures, the higher is the accuracy.

1.13 Rounding off the digits  

            When rounding off numbers to a certain number of significant figures, do  
so to the nearest value. If the last digit is more than 5, the retained digit is  
increased by one and if it is less than 5, it is retained as such.  
For example:  
            (i)  Round to 2 significant figures: 2.512 × 10³ m.  
                                                                                                Answer: 2.5 × 10³ m  
            (ii) Round to 3 significant figures: 3.4567 × 10⁴ kg.   
                                                                                                Answer: 3.46 × 10⁴ kg  
            For the integer 5, there is an arbitrary rule:  
If the number before the 5 is odd, one is added to the last digit retained.  
If the number before the 5 is even, it remains the same:  

                                                                    22

                                                                              2

            Sometimes, logic is applied to decide the fate  
 of   a   digit.  If   we   round  to   2  significant  figures

4.452 × 10  m, the answer should be 4.5 × 10  m since                                          can measure time

                                                   KEY POINTS  

      A physical quantity can be measured directly or indirectly using some instruments.  

      Non-physical quantity is not measurable using an instrument. It qualitatively depends  
       on the perception of the observer and estimated only.  

      Base quantities are length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, etc.  

      Derived quantities are all those quantities which can be defined with reference to  
       base quantities. For example, speed, area, volume, etc.  

      Standard  unit  does  not  vary  from  person  to  person  and  understood  by  all  the  
       scientists.  

      Base units of system international are: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, candela,  
       kelvin and mole.  

      The units which can be expressed in terms of base units are called derived units.  

      Scientific notation is an internationally accepted way of writing numbers in which  
       numbers  are  recorded  using  the  powers  of  ten  or  prefixes  and  there  is  only  one  
       non-zero digit before the decimal.  

      Least count is the least measurement recorded by an instrument.  

      Vernier Callipers is an instrument which can measure length correct up to 0.1 mm.  

      Screw guage is an instrument which can measure length correct up to 0.01 mm.  

      Measurements using instruments are not perfect. There are inevitable errors in the  
       measured values, may be due to human errors, systematic errors and random errors.  

      Measurements using instruments errors are uncertain to some extent depending  
       upon the limitations or refinement of the instrument.  

      Significant figures are the accurately known digits and first doubtful digit in any  
       measurement.  

      The precision is detemined by the instrument being used for  measurement whereas  
       the accuracy depends on relative measurement reflected by the number of significant  
       figures.
