﻿          Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects  
and the forces that change it.  
Generally, mechanics is divided into two branches:  
          1. Kinematics                                      2. Dynamics  
          Kinematics is the study of  motion of objects without  referring to forces.  
On the other hand, dynamics deals with forces and their effect on the motion of  
objects.  
          In our everyday life, we observe many objects in motion. For example,  
cars,  buses,  bicycles,  motorcycles  moving  on  the  roads,  aeroplanes  flying  
through air, water flowing in canals or some object falling from the table to the  
ground.  
The motion of these objects can be studied with or without considering the force  
which causes motion in them or changes it.  
  

2.1 Scalars and Vectors  

          Before we study kinematics in detail, we should know about the nature of  
various physical quantities. Some quantities are called scalars and the others  
vectors.  

  

                          A scalar is that physical quantity which can be  
                          described completely by its magnitude only.  

          Magnitude includes a number and an appropriate unit. When we ask a  
shopkeeper to give us 5 kilograms of sugar, he can fully understand how much  
quantity we want. It is the magnitude of mass of sugar. Mass is a scalar quantity.  
Some  other  examples  of  scalar  quantities  are  distance,  length,  time,  speed,  
energy and temperature. Scalar quantities can be added up like numbers.  
          For example,      5 metres + 3 metres = 8 metres.  
On the other hand,  

  

                  A  vector  is  that  physical  quantity  which  needs  
                  magnitude as well as direction to describe it completely.  

          The   examples   of  vector   quantities   are  displacement,  velocity,  
acceleration, weight, force, etc. The velocity of a car moving at 90 kilometre per  

                  −1 
hour (25 m s  ) towards north can be represented by a vector. Velocity is a vector  
quantity  because  it  has  magnitude  25  m  s−1                     and  direction  (towards  north).  

Vectors  cannot  be  added  like  scalars.  There  are  specific  methods  to  add  up  
vectors. These methods take their directions also into consideration.

﻿Representation of vectors  
                                                             
            In the text book, symbol used for a vector is a bold face letter such as A, v,  
F and          etc. Since we cannot write in bold face script on paper, so a vector is  
                                                                                  →    → → → 
written as the letter with a small arrow over it, i.e. A, v,  F, d. The magnitude of a   
vector is given  by italic  letter without arrow head. A vector can  be  represented   

graphically by drawing a straight line with an arrow head at one end. The length  
of line represents the magnitude of the vector quantity according to a suitable  
scale while the direction of arrow indicates the direction of the vector.  
                                                                                                                      v  
To  represent  the  direction,  two  mutually                                                                 N  
perpendicular lines are required. We can draw one  
line to represent east-west direction and the other  
                                                                                                                      θ  
line to represent north-south direction as shown in  W                                                                              E  
Fig.2.1(a).  The  direction  of  a  vector  can  be  given                                                  O  

with respect to these lines. Mostly, we use any two  
lines  which  are  perpendicular  to  each  other.                                                            S  
Horizontal line (x x )  is called x-axis and vertical line                                A vector v making an angle θ  
( y y ) is called y-axis (Fig. 2.1-b). The point where                                        towards north from east  
these  axes  meet  is  known  as  origin.  The  origin  is                                                Fig 2.1 (a)  
usually  denoted  by  O.  These  axes  are  also  called                                                      y                F  

            A vector is drawn starting from the origin of

                                                                                                            O  
direction is usually given by an angle θ  (theta) with                                         
x-axis. The angle with x-axis is always measured from                                          
the right side of x-axis in the anti-clockwise direction.                                                     y

Resultant Vector  
  
          We can add two or more vectors to get a single vector. This is called as  
resultant vector. It has the same effect as the combined effect of all the vectors to  
be added. We have to determine both magnitude and direction of the resultant  
vector, therefore, it is quite different from that of scalar addition. One method of  
addition of vectors is the graphical method.  

  

Addition of Vectors by Graphical Method  
                                                                                              y  
          Let  us  add  two  vectors v1  and  v2   having  
magnitudes of 300 N and 400 N acting at angles  

        o           o  
of 30  and 60  with x-axis.  By selecting a suitable  
                                                                                                   60O  
scale  100  N  =  1cm, we  can  draw the vectors  as  
                                                                                                             O  
                                                                                                          30

          To  add  these  vectors,  we  apply  a  rule  
called head-to-tail rule, which states that:  
  
  
                                                                                                    Fig. 2.4 (a)

             To add a number of vectors, redraw their representative lines  
             such that the head of one line coincides with the tail of the other.  
             The resultant vector is given by a single vector which is directed  
             from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.

2.2 Rest and Motion                                                                                             Fig. 2.4 (b)  
                                                                                                    y  

            When we look around us, we see many things like buildings, trees, electric  
poles, etc. which do not change their positions. We say that they are in a state of  
rest.  
  
  
  
  

  
                                                                                                    
                                                                  Fig. 2.5 (a)  

                            If  a  body  does  not  change  its  position  with  
                            respect to its surroundings, it is said to be at rest.  

            Suppose a motorcyclist is standing on the road (Fig. 2.5-a). An observer  
sees that he is not changing his position with respect to his surroundings i.e., a  
nearby building, tree or a pole. He will say that the motorcyclist is at rest.  
             Now let us see what does motion mean? When the motorcyclist is driving  
(Fig. 2.5-b), the observer will notice that he is continuously changing his position  
with respect to the surroundings. Then the observer will say that the motorcyclist  
is in motion.  

  If a body continuously changes its position with  
  respect to its surroundings, it is said to be in  
  motion.  

  

The  state  of  rest  or  motion  of  a  body  is  always   
                                                                                           
relative.  For  example,  a  person  standing  in  the                                                                                        
compartment  of  a  moving  train  is  at  rest  with                                                       Fig. 2.5 (b)  

respect to the  other  passengers  in the  compartment  but  he  is  in  motion with  
respect to an observer standing on the platform of a railway station.  

                                                                     32  
﻿2.3 Types of Motion  
                                                             

             We observe different types of motion in our daily life. A train moves almost  
along a straight line, the blades of a fan rotate about an axis, a swing vibrates  
about its mean position. Generally, there are three types of motion of bodies.  
1. Translatory motion      2. Rotatory motion                                                        3. Vibratory motion  

  

1. Translatory Motion  

If the motion of a body is such that every  
particle of the body moves uniformly in  
the same direction, it is called tanslatory  
motion.  For  example,  the  motion  of  a  
train or a car is tanslatory motion (Fig.2.6).  
Translatory motion can be of three types:                                                                                                          
                                                                     Fig. 2.6 The motion of a train is translatory motion   
(i.)  Linear Motion  
        If the body moves along a straight line, it is  
        called linear motion. A freely falling body is  
        the example of linear motion.  
(ii.) Random Motion                                                                      (a)  Irregular path       (b) The motion of bee   
                                                                                                                     
        If the body moves along an irregular path                                              Fig. 2.7              is random motion  
        (Fig. 2.7), the motion is called random motion.  
(iii.)Circular Motion  
        The motion of a body along a circle is called circular   
        motion. If a ball tied to one end of a string is whirled, it  
        moves along a circle. A Ferris wheel is also an example of   
                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                    Circular Motion  
        circular motion (Fig.2.8).                                                                                  
                                                                                                                            Fig. 2.8  

2. Rotatory Motion  
  
If each point of a body moves around a fixed point (axis),                                                       
the  motion  of  this  body  is  called  rotatory  motion.  For                                                  

example, the motion of an electric fan and the drum of a                                                         
                                                                                                                 Rotatory motion of a fan  
washing  machine  dryer  is  rotatory  motion  (Fig.2.9).  The  
                                                                                                                            Fig. 2.9  
motion of a top is also rotatory motion.  
                                                                                                                 
  
                                                                                                                 
3. Vibratory Motion                                                                                              
When a body repeats its to and fro motion about a fixed                                                          
position, the motion is called vibratory motion. The motion                                                      
                                                                                                                 
of a swing in a children park is vibratory motion (Fig. 2.10).  
                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                    Fig. 2.10     Vibratory  motion  
                                                                       33  

  
﻿2.4 Distance and Displacement  
                                                                                         
             We know that motion is the action of an object going from one place to  
another  or  change  of  position.  The  length  between  the  original  and  final  
positions may be measured in two ways as either distance or displacement.  

                      The distance is the length of actual path of the motion.                                                               

             Let a person be travelling from Lahore to Multan in a car. On reaching  
Multan, he reads the speedometer and notices that he has travelled a distance of  
320 km. It is the distance travelled by that person. Obviously, it is not the shortest  
distance from Lahore to Multan, as the car took many turns in the way. He did not  
travel along a straight line.  
  
       The displacement of an object is a vector quantity whose magnitude is  
       the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of the motion  
       and  its  direction  is  from  the  initial  position  to  the  final  position.  
  
                                                                                                                                             B  
  We  can  also  call  this  as  the  change  in  position.  
  Note  that  displacement  is  a  vector  quantity                                                                 d  
  whereas distance is a scalar quantity. Following  
example  will  explain  the  difference  between  
  distance and displacement.                                                               A  
                                                                                                              Fig. 2.11  

Suppose a car travels from a position A to B. The curved line is the actual path  
followed by the car (Fig. 2.11). The total distance covered by the car will be equal  
to the length of the curved line AB. The displacement d  is the straight line AB  
directed  from  A  to  B  as  indicated  by  the  arrow  head.  The  SI  unit  for  the  
displacement is the same as that of distance.  

  

2.5 Speed and Velocity                                                                                             Do You Know?  
                                                  We  are  often  interested  to

                                     know how fast a body is moving. For

The speed is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of speed is m s ¹ or km h ¹.  
 It is obvious that speed of a vehicle does not  remain constant throughout the  
journey.  If the reading of the speedometer of the vehicle is observed, it is always  
 changing. The speed of a vehicle that is shown by its speedometer at any instant  
 is called instantaneous speed. Practically we make use of the average speed. It  
 is defined as:  
                                               Total distance covered                                                     S  
              Average speed =                                                                  or            v     =

 Velocity  

             The speed of an object does not tell anything about the direction of  
 motion. To take into account the direction, the vector concept is needed. For this,  
we have to find the displacement d between the initial and final positions.  

  

                The net displacement of a body in unit time is called velocity.  

 If a body moves from point A to B along a curved path as shown in Fig.2.11, the  
 displacement d is the straight line AB, then  
  Average velocity  =  Displacement                                                 or       v     =    d ............ (2.2)  

                                                                                               av

Velocity  is  a  vector  quantity.  The  Equation  (2.2)  shows  that  the  direction  of  
velocity v is the same as that of displacement d. The SI unit of velocity is also m s–1

with  uniform  velocity  is  the  downward  motion  of  a  
paratrooper. When a paratrooper jumps  from an aeroplane, he falls freely for a  
few moments. Then the parachute opens. At this stage the force of gravity acting  
downwards  on  the  paratrooper  is  balanced  by  the  resistance  of  air  on  the  
parachute that acts upward. Consequently, the paratrooper moves down with  
uniform velocity.  

2.6 Acceleration  

  

Whenever the velocity of an object is increasing, we   
                                                                                                                             
say that the object is accelerating. For example, when   
a car overtakes another one, it accelerates to a greater   
                                                                                                                             
velocity  (Fig.2.12).  In  contrary  to  that  the  velocity   
decreases when brakes are applied to slow down a

                    Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity.  
                                                                                                                                                                         
The change in velocity can occur in magnitude or direction or both of them. The  
acceleration is positive if the velocity is increasing and it is negative if the velocity  
is decreasing. Negative acceleration is also called deceleration or retardation.  
Acceleration is a vector quantity like velocity, but the direction of acceleration is  
that of change of velocity. If a body is moving with an initial velocity v and after  
                                                                                                                                                                i

                                                                                     f                                                                             f       i  

occurs in time t. In this case, rate of change of velocity i.e., acceleration will be  
average acceleration.

in distance-time graph, t is independent and S is dependent variable. Therefore,  

t should be along x-axis and S along y-axis.  

         To represent a physical quantity along any axis, a suitable scale is chosen  

by considering the minimum and maximum values of the quantity.  

  

Distance-Time Graph  

Distance-time graph shows the relation between distance S and time t taken by a  
moving body.  
Let a car be moving in a straight line on a motorway. Suppose that we measure its  
distance from starting point after every one minute, and record it in the table  
given below:  
       Time  
                        0              1             2              3             4              5

﻿Follow the steps given below to draw a graph on a centimetre graph paper:  
i.      Take time t along x-axis and distance S along y-axis.  
ii.     Select suitable scales (1 minute = 1 cm) along x-axis and (1.2 km =1 cm)  
        along y-axis. The graph paper shown here is not to the scale.  
iii.    Mark the values of each  big division along x                                    y                    
                                                                                                              
        and y axes according to the scale.                                           
                                                                                        6.0                   
iv.     Plot all pairs of values of time and distance by                                                      
                                                                                    )

                                                                                        3.6  
v.      Join all the plotted points to obtain a best  S                                                       
                                                                                                              
        straight line as shown in Fig. 2.14. From the                                   2.4                   
        table, we can observe that car has covered                                      1.2                   
                                                                                                              
        equal distance in equal intervals of time. This                                                       
        shows  that  the  car   moves  with  uniform                                      O      1     2      3     4     5      X  
                                                                                                          t  (min)  
        speed.   Therefore,   a   straight   line   graph                                               Fig. 2.14  
        between time and distance represents motion with uniform speed.  

 Now consider another journey of the car as recorded in the table given below:  

  

        Time  
                              0                 1                 2                 3                 4                 5  
       t (min)  
      Distance  
                              0             0.240             0.960             2.160             3.840             6.000  
       S (km)  

Table shows that speed goes on increasing in equal intervals of time. This is very  
obvious from the graph as shown in Fig. 2.15. The graph line is curved upward.  
This is the case when the body (car) is moving with certain acceleration.  
                                                 y  
                                            6.000  
  
                                             5.000

                                            2.000  

                                             1.000  
                                                  0  
                                                 O 0       1       2       3      4       5      X  

                                                                        t (min)  
  
                                                                  Fig. 2.15  

                                                                 39  

  
﻿In another case, consider the following table:  

  

           Time  
                                        0                        1                       2                        3                       4                        5  
          t (min)  
        Distance  
                                        0                      2.0                      3.1                     4.0                     4.6                      5.0  
          S (km)  

The graph line is curved downwards. This shows that distance travelled in the  
same interval of time goes on decreasing, so speed is decreasing. This is the case  
of motion with deceleration or negative acceleration as shown in Fig.2.16.

Graph line is horizontal in this case (Fig 2.17). It shows that the distance covered  
by the car does not change with change in time. It means that the car is not  
moving; it is at rest.

2.9 Speed-Time Graph  

             Suppose we can note the speed of the same car after every one second  
and record it in the table given below, we can draw the graph between speed v  
versus time t. This is called speed-time graph.  

                                                                       Table

﻿Take t along x-axis and v along y-axis. Scale can be selected as 1 s = 1 cm (x-axis)  
and speed 10 m s − 1  = 1 cm along y-axis.  

Shape of the graph is shown in Fig. 2.19· It is a straight line rising upward. This  
shows that speed increases by the same amount after every one second. This is a  
motion with uniform acceleration. It is also evident from the table.

In this case, graph line is horizontal (Fig. 2.20) parallel to time x- axis. It shows that  
speed does not change with change in time. This is a motion with constant  
speed.

Now consider the speed-time graph (Fig. 2.21). The speeds at times t₁ and t₂ are  
v₁ and v₂  respectively. The change in speed in a time interval (t₂ - t₁) is (v₂ -v₁).

Hence                                      Gradient of the speed-Time graph is equal  

                                           to  the  average  acceleration  of  the  body.  

This shows that when a car moves with constant acceleration, the velocity-time  
graph is a straight line which rises through same height for equal intervals of time.  

                 Graph of Fig. 2.19 is redrawn in Fig. 2.22 to find its slope. The speed v₁ at  
time t₁ is the same as speed v₂ at time t₂, hence, the change in speed is also zero.

speed-time graph. For example, figure 2.23 shows that the object is moving  
with constant speed v.  For a time-interval t, the distance covered by the object  
as given by  Eq. 2.1 is  v × t.

﻿While applying these equations, the following assumptions are made:  
(i.)        Motion is always considered along a straight line  
(ii.)      Only the magnitudes of vector quantities are used.  
(iii.)     Acceleration is assumed to be uniform.  
(iv.)    The direction of initial velocity is taken as positive. Other quantities which  
            are in the direction of initial velocity are taken as positive. The quantities in  
           the direction opposite to the initial velocity are taken as negative.  

2.13 Free Fall Acceleration  

When  a  body  is  falling  freely  under  the  action  of  gravity  of  the  Earth,  the  
acceleration acting on it is the gravitational acceleration and is denoted by g. The  

                                                                                                                               − 
direction of gravitational acceleration is always downwards. Its value is 9.8 m s ²,  
but for convenience we shall use the value of g as 10 m s− ².

                                                       downwards  in  a  straight  line  with  uniform  
                                                       acceleration  g,  so  the  three  equations  of  
                                                        motion can be applied to the motion of such  
                                                        bodies. While applying equations of motion,  
                                                       the  acceleration  a  is  replaced  by  g.  Thus,

(i.)      If  a  body  is  released  from  some  height  to  fall

(ii.)      The gravitational acceleration g will be taken as  
            positive  in  the  downward  direction.  All  other

            taken as negative.

Relativity  
                             

           In  1905,  famous  scientist  Albert  Einstein  proposed  his  revolutionary  
theory of special relativity which modified many of the basic concepts of physics.  
According  to  this  theory,  speed  of  light  is  a  universal  constant.  Its  value  is  

                                 8      − 1 
approximately 3 ×10  m s                   . Speed of light remains the same for all motions. Any  
object with mass cannot achieve speeds equal to or greater than that of light.  
This is known as universal speed limit.  

                                                      KEY POINTS  

         A scalar is that physical quantity which can be described completely by its magnitude  
          only.  
         A vector is that physical quantity which needs magnitude as well as direction to  
          describe it completely.  
         To add a number of vectors, redraw their representative lines such that the head of  
          one line coincides with the tail of the other. The resultant vector is given by a single  
          vector which is directed from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.  
         Translatory motion, rotatory motion and vibratory motions are different types of  
          motion.  
         Position of any object is its distance and direction from a fixed point.  
         The shortest distance between the initial and final positions of a body is called its  
          displacement.  
         Distance covered by a body in a unit time is called its speed.  
         Time rate of displacement of a body is called its velocity.  
         The velocity is said to be uniform if the speed and direction of a moving body does not  
          change, otherwise it is non-uniform velocity.  
         Rate of change of velocity of a body is called its acceleration.  
         If change of velocity with time is constant, the acceleration is said to be uniform,  
          otherwise it is non-uniform.  
         A graph that shows the relation between distance and time taken by a moving body is  
          called a distance-time graph.  
         A graph that shows the relation between the speed and time taken by a moving body  
          is called a speed-time graph.  
         Gradient or slope of the distance-time graph is equal to the average speed of the  
          body. Slope of the speed-time graph is equal to the acceleration of the body.
