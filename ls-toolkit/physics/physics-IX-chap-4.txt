             moment  (in  which  case  it  would  begin  to  accelerate  or  decelerate  its  rotational  
             motion)]

       •     [SLO: P-09-B-53] Identify the sources of centripetal force in real life examples [e.g.,  
             tension in a string for a stone being swirled around, gravity for the Moon orbiting the  
             Earth]  

           As we know, a force is a vector quantity, so it acts in a particular direction.  
We  observe  various  effects  of  forces.  Some  forces  produce  acceleration  or  
decelerating in a body, some tend to turn it around a point and some forces  
balance each other acting in opposite directions.  
           All those forces which act parallel to one another are known as parallel  
forces. The points of application of such forces may be different.

  4.2 Addition of Forces  
                                                                           
            In  chapter  2,  we  have  learnt  about  vectors  and  their  representation.  
Remember that the resultant is the same for any order of addition of vectors. As  
forces are vectors, so forces can also be added by head-to-tail rule.  
            To determine the resultant of two or more forces acting in a plane, the  
following example will explain its method.  

  Example 4.1    

            Let  us add three force vectors  F ,  F  and  F  having  magnitudes of 200  N,  
                                                                     1    2           3  
                                                                          O       O       O  
300 N and 250 N acting at angles of 30 , 45 , 60                                             with x -axis. By selecting a  
suitable scale 100 N = 1 cm, we can draw  
the force vectors as shown in Fig. 4.2(a).                                                                                         F₃  
            To  add  these  vectors,  we  apply

﻿  4.3 Turning Effect of a Force  
                                                                                    
           We have learnt so far that a net force affects the liner motion of an object  
by causing it to accelerate. Since rigid objects can also rotate, so we need to  
extend our concept to the turning effect of a force. When we open or close a  
door, we apply force. This force rotates the door about its hinge. This is called  
turning effect of force. Similarly, we use turning effect of force when we open or  
close a water tap. Let us define some terms used in the study of turning effect of a  
force.  
           If the distance between two points of the body remains the same under  
the action of a force, it is called a rigid body.                                               Axis of rotation  
                                                                                                       z  
           During rotation, all the particles of the rigid body  
                                                                                                               A    Rigid

rotate along fixed circles as shown in Fig. 4.3. The straight                                                              
                                                                                                                    body 

line joining the centres of these circles is called the axis of   
                                                                                                                        y

of a force, let us perform an activity.  

  

 Activity 4.1  

             Take your class to play ground where                                          Pivot  
  a see-saw is available. Let a lighter child sits  
  on the left side and the heavier one on the                            Moment arm              Moment arm  
  right  side  of  the  see-saw.  The  distances  of  
  both the children from the pivot should be equal. The force exerted by each child is equal to his  
  weight acting downward. Does the heavier child move down? Yes, because he is exerting  
  larger force. Now move the heavier child nearer to the pivot and the lighter child away from  
  the pivot as shown in the figure. Ask the students what do they observe?  
                                                                                                                                
           You will see that the see-saw tilts to the opposite direction and the lighter  
child moves down. This shows that the turning effect of a force does not depend  
only on its magnitude but also on the location where it acts. Therefore, we can  
say that the greater the force, the greater is its turning effect. Moreover, the  
larger  the  perpendicular  distance  of  the  force  from  the  axis  of  rotation,  the  
greater is its turning effect.  
                                  The line along which the force acts is  
                                  called the line of action of the force.  

           The perpendicular distance of the line of action of a force from the axis  
          of rotation is known as moment arm of the force or simply moment arm.  

           The  moment  arms  of  both  the  children  are  shown  in  the  figure  of  
activity 4.1. There are many other examples to observe the turning or rotational  
effect of a force. It is harder to open a door by pushing it at a point closer to the  

                                                             82  
  
﻿hinge as compared to push it at the handle (Fig. 4.4). That is why, door or window  
handles  are  always  installed  at  larger  distances  from  hinges  to  
produce larger moment of force by applying less force. This makes  
the doors be opened or closed more easier. Similarly, it requires  
greater force to open a nut by a spanner if you hold it closer such as  
point A than point B (Fig. 4.5).                                  F

              The turning effect of a force is measured by a     
quantity known as moment of force or torque.                                                                         O      r  = ℓ                P

        Moment of a force or torque is defined as the                                                           
            product of the force and the moment arm.                                                                          Fig. 4.6

therefore, moment arm    = r. Remember                                                   opening a bottle.  

that the torque of a force is zero when the line of action of a force passes through  
the  axis  of  rotation,  because  its  moment  arm  becomes  zero.  The  torque  is  
positive if the force tends to produce an anticlockwise rotation about the axis,  
and it is taken as negative if the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation. The  
SI unit of torque is newton metre (N m).  
              In many cases, the line joining  the axis of rotation and point P where the  
force  F acts, is not perpendicular to the force  F. Therefore, OP will not be the  
moment  arm  for  F.  In  such  cases,  we  have  to  find  a  component  of  force  F  
perpendiculars to OP  =                              (Fig. 4.7), or we can find r the component of                                                  that is  
perpendicular to the (line of action) force F (Fig. 4.8).

﻿For this, we need to know the method of finding rectangular components of a  
force or any vector. This is also called as resolution of  Forces.  

  

  Couple  

           A couple is a special type of torque. We observe at many situations in our  
daily  life,  when  two  equal  and  opposite  parallel  forces  produce  torque.  For  
example,  while  opening  or  closing  a  water  tap,  
                                                                                                                   F

                 When two equal and opposite parallel forces act at two  
                  different points of the same body, they form a couple.

  While turning a vehicle, a couple is applied on the steering    
  wheel.  It  is  interesting  to  know  that  now-a-days,  steering  
  wheels of smaller diameter are installed in vehicles. The reason  
   is that, most of the fvehicles are provided with power steering  
   in which a pump pushes hydraulic fluid to reduce the force  
   needed to turn the wheels, resulting in effortless steering.                        

  Example 4.2    

           A spanner 25 cm long is used to open a nut. If a force of 400 N is applied at  
the end of a spanner shown in Fig. 4.10, what is the torque acting on the nut?  

  Solution                  
Length of Spanner                    =  25 cm = 0.25 m                                                        F

From Eq. (4.1),                             τ = F ×  
Putting the values,                         τ = 400 N × 0.25 m =100 N m  

  

  4.4 Resolution of Vectors  
                                                                        

           By head-to-tail rule, two or more vectors can be added to give a resultant  
vector. Its reverse process is also possible, i.e., a given vector can be divided into  
two or more parts. These parts are called as components of the given vector.  If  
these components are added up, their resultant is equal to the given vector. To  
divide a force into its components is known as resolution of a force.

  4.7 Centre of Gravity and Centre of Mass  
                                                                                                     
           An object is composed of a large number of small particles. Each particle is  
acted  upon  by  the  gravitational  force  directed  towards  the  centre  of  the  
Earth (Fig. 4.14-a). As the object is small as compared to the Earth, the value of g  
can be taken as uniform over all particles. Therefore, each particle experiences  
the  same  force  mg.  Since  all  these  forces  are  parallel  and  act  in  the  same  
direction, so their resultant as shown in Fig. 4.14(b) will be equal to the sum of all  
these forces .i.e,  

  
                                                                                                C

﻿          We know that the sum of the gravitational forces acting on all particles is  
equal  to  the  total  weight  of  the  object  w  =  Mg  Where    M  =  ∑  m  =  mass  of  the  
object.  

                          Centre of gravity is that point where total  
                           weight of the body appears to be acting.  

          If  a  body  is  supported  at  its  centre  of  gravity,  it  stays  there  without  
rotation. The centre of gravity of an object of regular shape lies at its geometrical  
centre. Centre of gravity of some geometrical shapes is  given in Table 4.1.

  Centre of Gravity of a Plane Lamina  

          For an irregular shaped plane lamina, the centre of gravity can be found  
by suspending it freely through different points (Fig. 4.15-a). Each time the object  
is suspended, its centre of gravity  lies on the                                                      Points of  
vertical   line  drawn  from  the   point  of                                                        suspension  
suspension with the help of a plumbline. The                                                  CG  
exact position of the centre of gravity is at the   
point where two such lines cross each other as   
                                                                 
shown in the Fig 4.15(b). The centre of gravity   
can exist inside a body or outside the body as   
is in case of a cup.                                                Fig. 4.15(a)        Fig. 4.15(b)

          Newton’s second law of motion is applicable to  
single particle or system of particles. Even when the  
parts   of   a   system   have   different   velocities   and                               CG  

acceleration, there is still one point in the system whose  
acceleration could be found by applying second law.                             Centre of gravity of a bowl  
This point is called the centre of mass of the system.                            is outside the material.

﻿                    The centre of mass of a body is that point where the  
                 whole mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated.  
                                                                                                          
           Hence, the centre of mass behaves as if all the mass of the body or system  
is lying at that point. In the (Fig. 4.16) given below, a rotating wrench slides along  
a frictionless floor. There is no resultant force on the wrench. Therefore, its centre  
of mass, shown by a yellow dot, follows a linear path with constant speed.  

  

                       Fig. 4.16: Rotating wrench sliding along a frictionless floor  

          On the surface of the Earth, where g is almost uniform, the centre of mass  
of an object coincides with its centre of gravity.  

  

  4.8 Equilibrium  

          We have learnt how translatory and rotational motion can be caused due  
to the application of external forces. Now, we shall see how external forces can be  
balanced  to   produce   no  translational  or                                        Do You Know?  
rotational effects.  
     We know that if a number of forces act on a  
body such that their  resultant is zero, the  body  
remains  at  rest  or  continues  to  move  with  
uniform velocity if already in motion. This state  
of the body is known as equilibrium, which can                                      This is a fascinating  
be stated as:                                                                      scene of equilibrium.  
  

               A body is said to be in equilibrium if it has no acceleration.  

There are two types of equilibrium:  
(i)  Static equilibrium             (ii)  Dynamic equilibrium  
     A body at rest is in static equilibrium whereas a body moving with uniform  
velocity is in dynamic equilibrium.  

          An example of static equilibrium is a book lying on the table as shown in  
the  Fig. 4.17. Only two forces are acting on  it. One  is its weight w  = mg acting  

                                                          90  
  
﻿downward and the other is F  the normal force that the   
                                                      n  
table exerts upward on the book. Since the book is at rest   
so, it has zero acceleration. Therefore, the sum of all the   
                                                                                                         
forces acting on the book should be zero, so that the   
book is said to be in equilibrium. Hence

  4.9 Conditions of Equilibrium                                                           A  paratrooper is in dynamic equilibrium  
                                                                                                        Fascinating  Freefall  
             There are two conditions of equilibrium:  

  

  First Condition of Equilibrium  
                                                                             

             By Newton’s second law of motion,  F = ma  
If the body is in translational equilibrium, then a = 0,  
therefore, net force F should be 0  or  ∑F=0 ........ (4.7)  
             This  is  the  mathematical  form  of  the  first                                                                                  
condition of equilibrium which states that:                                                      A group of paratroopers making  
                                                                                                  in a formation-an example of  
                                                                                                        dynamic equilibrium.  
  
                A body is said to be in translational equilibrium only if the vector   

                       sum of all the external forces acting on it is equal to zero.  
             In case a number of coplanar forces F , F , F , .... having their resultant  
                                                                                  1    2     3 

equal to  F,  are acting on a  body, these can  be  resolved  into their  rectangular  

                                                                      91  
  
﻿components, and first condition of equilibrium can be then written as:  
Along x-direction,                        F  + F  + F  +…… =  0 1x  2x 
or                                                                   ∑ F  =  0              …… (4.8)  
                                                                           x  

Similarly, along y-direction,  
                                        F  + F  + F  +  ……  = 0  
                                          1y       2y 
or                                                                  ∑ F  =  0               ……(4.9)  
                                                                         y  

             Thus, first condition of equilibrium can also be stated as:  

  

     The sum of all the components of forces along x-axis should be zero and  
     the sum of all the components of forces along y-axis should also be zero.  

  

  Second Condition of Equilibrium  

             The second condition of equilibrium implies to the rotational equilibrium  
which means that the body should not rotate under the action of the forces.  
             Consider the example of a  rigid  body in  Fig.4.20. Two forces  F  and F of  
                                                                                                                                     1            2  

equal magnitude are acting on it. In case (a), both the forces act along the same  
line of action.  

  

                                                                                            F 
                                                                                             2            B  

                             F           A     o     B  
                              2  
                                                                                                        o  
                                                                 F 
                                                                   1  

                                                                                                          A            F  
                                                                                                                         1  
                                                                                                                            
                                              (a)                  Fig. 4.20                           (b)  

              In  case  (b),  the  lines  of  action  of  the  two  forces  are  different.  Since  
magnitude of F  and F  are equal, so the resultant force is zero in both the cases.  
                              1           2  

Thus, first condition of equilibrium is satisfied. But you can observe that in case  
(b), the forces are forming a couple which can apply torque to rotate the  body  
about point O. Therefore, for a body to be completely in equilibrium, a second  
condition is also required. That is, no net torque should be acting. This is the  
second condition of equilibrium which can be stated as:  

                                  The vector sum of all the torques acting on  
                                       a body about any point must be zero.  

Mathematically, we can write:                                                  ∑ τ  = 0                                ……(4.10 )  
Hence, a body will be in complete equilibrium when,  
                                                                 ∑ F  = 0  
                                                             {  x  
                                                                 ∑ F  = 0  
                                                                      y  

                                      And                          ∑ τ = 0  

                                                                          92  
  
﻿  Solving Problems by Applying Conditions of Equilibrium

applying conditions of equilibrium.  
1.          First of all, select the objects to which Eqs. (4.8)  
            and (4.9) are to be applied. Each object should  
            be treated separately.  
2.          Draw  a  diagram  to  show  the  objects  and  
            forces acting on them. Only the forces acting                                        Most balancing toys  
            on the objects should be included. The forces                                   have a low centre of mass.  
            which the objects exert on their environment should not be included.  
3.          Choose a set of x, y axes such that as many forces as possible lie directly  
            along x-axis or y-axis, it will minimize the number of forces to be resolved  
            into components.  
4.          Resolve all the forces which are not parallel to either of the axes, in their  
            rectangular components.  
5.          Apply Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) by putting  ∑  F  = 0 and ∑  F  = 0 to get two  
                                                                                  x                      y  

            equations.  
6.          If needed, apply Eq. (4.10) by putting ∑τ = 0 to get another equation.  
7.          The equations can be solved simultaneous to find out desired unknown  
            quantities.

  4.10 States of Equilibrium  

      An object is balanced when its centre of mass and  its point of support lie on  
the same vertical line. Then forces on each side are balanced, and the  object is  
said to be in equilibrium. There are three states of equilibrium in connection with  
stability of the balanced bodies.  

  

  Stable Equilibrium  

  

                        A body is said to be in a state of stable equilibrium, if  
                        after a slight tilt, it comes back to its original position.  

       Stable equilibrium occurs when the torques arising from the rotation (tilt) of  
the object compel the body back towards its equilibrium position.  
      The cone shown in Fig 4.22(a) is in the state of stable equilibrium. Its weight w  
acting downward at the centre of gravity  
G and the  reaction of the floor  Fn   acting  
upward,  lie  on  the  same  vertical  line.                                                    F 
                                                                                                 n                    F            G  
                                                                                                                        n  
Since  these  forces   are   equal   and   in                                                       G

equilibrium are satisfied.  
      As you try to push over the cone slightly, its centre of gravity is raised but it  
still remains above the base of the cone. The weight w and the normal force F do  
                                                                                                                                              n  

not remain in the same line but act like two unlike parallel forces. The cone does  
not remain in equilibrium. Unlike parallel forces produce a clockwise torque  
which brings the cone back to its original position.  It is worth noting that the  
body remains in equilibrium as long its centre of mass lies within the base.  

                                                                        94

     Try to balance the cone on its tip. It is balanced for a moment because w and  
Fn   lie along the same line. Even it is slightly tilted, it will not come back to its  
original position by itself. Rather it will fall downward, because its centre of mass  
no   longer   remains  above  the   base.   It  
topples over, because line of action of w no  
longer  lies  inside the  base O  (Fig. 4.23).  In                            G                        G

       A body is said to be in a state of unstable equilibrium if, after a slight  
            tilt, it tends to move on further away from its original position.  
  

  Neutral Equilibrium  
                                           
     A  cylinder  resting  on  a  horizontal  surface  (Fig.  4.24)  shows  the  neutral  
equilibrium.  If the  cylinder  is  rotated  slightly,  there  is  no  force  or  torque that  
brings it back to its original position or moves it away. As the                                     Fn  

cylinder  rotates,  the  height  of  the  centre  of  mass  remains                               G  
unchanged.  In  any  position  of  the  cylinder,  its  weight  and                                               
reaction of the ground lie in the same vertical line.                                                w  Fig. 4.24  

              A body is in neutral equilibrium if it comes to rest  in its new  
         position after disturbance without any change in its centre of mass.  

     Other examples of neutral equilibrium are a ball rolling  
on  a  horizontal  surfaces,  or  a  cone  resting  on  its  curved  
surface (Fig.4.25).                                                                              Fig. 4.25  

  4.11 Improvement of Stability  
  
     It is our daily life observation that a low armchair is more stable than a high  
chair   because  of  its   low  centre  of  gravity.  The                         Interesting Information!  
position of centre of gravity is very important when  
we are talking about stability. A bus can be stable or  
unstable depending on how it is loaded. If the heavy  
loads are placed on the floor of the bus, its centre of  
gravity will  be  low.  Now if it is disturbed slightly, a  
                                                                                 A double decker bus is being

                                                                                   tilting to test its stability.  

                                                          95  

  
﻿      In this case, the bus is in stable equilibrium. If the same bus is loaded with  
steel sheets on the top, the centre of gravity be raised. It is now near to a state of  
unstable equilibrium. A couple will turn it over if it is slightly tilted. The same is the  
case of ships and boats. We can improve the stability of a system either by  
lowering the centre of gravity or by widening the base.

  4.12 Application of Stability in Real Life  

            The  concept  of  stability  is  widely  applied  to  engineering  technology  
especially in manufacturing racing cars and balancing toys.  
            As the racing cars are driven at very high speeds and also there are sharp  
turns in the track, therefore, the chances of the cars to topple over increase. To  
enhance the stability of racing cars, their centres of mass are kept as low as  
possible. There base areas are also increased by keeping the wheel outside of

elders. Look at some balancing toys shown belows.

            The physics behind these types of toys is that stability is built in with  
balancing  toys.  These  toys  are  basically  in  completely  stable  state  and  their  
centres of gravity always remain below the pivot point. If the toys are disturbed in  
any  direction,  the  centre  of  gravity  is  raised  and  it  becomes  unstable  for  a  
moment. It comes back to its initial stable position by lowering its centre of  
gravity.  
                                                                    96  
  
﻿       The kids learn from these toys about stable systems and how they return to  
their state of initial rest position after being disturbed. Educational games on the  
basis   of   balancing   toys   have   also   been   developed   for   the   kids   as  
shown in Fig 4.27.

  Rotational Motion Versus Translatinal Motion   

             Counterparts                of     velocity,          acceleration,             force        and        momentum                 in  
translational motion are angular velocity, angular acceleration, moment of force  
(torque) and angular momentum respectively in rotational motion. It suggests  
that the torque plays the same role in the rotational motion that is played by the  
force  in  the  translational  motion.  Therefore,  we  are  justified  to  predict  that  
analogous to Newton's first law of motion, a rotating object will continue to do  
so with constant angular velocity unless acted upon by a resultant moment  
(torque).  However,  if  a  resultant  torque  is  applied  to  rotating  object,  it  will  
accelerate  depending  on  the  direction  of  the  torque  relative  to  the  axis  of  
rotation.  
             This  fundamental  principle  enhances  our  understanding  how  objects  
move and interact with their environment whether in linear or rotational motion  
scenarios.  

  

  Motion in a Circle  

             When a body is moving along a circular path, its  
velocity  at  any  point  is  directed  along  the  tangent  
                                                                                                                                            v  
drawn at that point. Figure 4.28 shows that the direction  
of  tangent  at  each  point  on  a  circle  is  different,                                                                           F  
therefore, the velocity of an object moving with uniform  
speed in a circle is changing constantly. Hence, a force  
perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  motion  is  always                                                               Fig. 4.28  

required to keep the object moving with uniform speed in a circular path.  

                                                                      97  
  
﻿            It should be noted that F is essentially perpendicular to v. For an instance,  
if it is not perpendicular to v, the force F will have a component in the direction of  
v. This will change the magnitude of velocity. As the body moves with constant  
speed, so it is possible only if the component of force along v is F cos 90° = 0.  

  

  4.13 Centripetal Force  

           We have studied above that an object can move in a circular path with  
uniform speed only if a force perpendicular to its velocity is acting constantly on  
it.  This  force  is  always  directed  towards  the  centre  of  the  circle.  It  is  called  
centripetal force and can be defined as:  

                      The force that causes an object to move in a circle at  
                            constant speed is called the centripetal force.  
                                                                                                                  

            For an object of mass m moving with uniform speed v in circle of radius r,  
the magnitude of centripetal force F  acting on it can be calculated by using the  
                                                            c

  Example 4.5  

           A 150 g stone attached to a string is whirled in a horizontal circle at a

force acting on the stone. Neglect effects of gravity.

Using  Eq.4.11,                               F =

  Sources of Centripetal Force                                                                
                                                                    
           We have learnt that centripetal force has to be  
                                                                                              
supplied if the body is to be maintained in its circular                                               (a)  
path. What could be the sources of centripetal force?                                          Fig. 4.29  

                                                                               A stone whirled in  a circle by a string

﻿            If we tie a stone to one end of a string and whirl it from the other end, we  
will have to exert a force on the stone through the string (Fig 4.29-a). If we release  
the string when it is at any point P, the stone will fly                                                            Q

off along the tangent (PQ) to the circle. Then, it will

move along the same straight line with constant                                             
velocity unless an unbalanced force acts upon it.                                                                    T  
                                                                                            
            In  fact,  the  tension  T  in  the  string  was                                                  O  
                                                                                            
providing the stone the necessary centripetal force                                         
to  keep  it  along  the  circular  path  (Fig  4.29-b).                                    
When we release the string we stop applying force                                           
on the stone and hence it moves in a straight line.                                                      Fig. 4.29 (b)  
  

                                                                                        

            Now consider the case of the moon which  
moves  around  the  Earth  at  constant  speed.  The  
gravity   of   the   Earth   provides   the   necessary  
centripetal force to keep it in its orbit. Same is the  
case of satellites orbiting the Earth in circular paths  
with uniform speed. The gravitational pull of  the                                                      Fig. 4.30                          

Earth provides centripetal force.                                                          A satellite orbiting the Earth  
  
                                                                                        
            One of the real life examples is a washing  
machine  dryer.  A  dryer  is  a  metallic  cylinderical  
drum with many small holes in its walls. Wet clothes  
are  put  in  it.  When  the  cylinder  rotates  rapidly,  
friction between clothes and drum walls provides  
necessary centripetal force. As the water molecules                                                                                    
are free to move, so they cannot get the required                                                       Fig. 4.31

results into quick drying of clothes.  
  
            Another  interesting  example  is  that  of  a

whirled rapidly.

﻿           The lighter particles of cream experience less centripetal force and gather  
in the central part of the machine. The heavier particles of milk need greater  
centripetal force to keep their circular motion in circles of small radius r.  In this  
way, they move away towards the walls.

      A force which is equal to the sum of all the forces is known as resultant force.  
      The line along which the force acts is called the line of action of the force.  
      The perpendicular distance of the line of action of a force from the axis of rotation is  
       known as moment arm of the force.  
      The torque or moment of a force is defined as the product of the force and the moment  
       arm.  
      When two equal and opposite, parallel forces act at two different points of the same body,  
       they form a couple.  
      The centre of gravity is a point inside or outside the body at which the whole weight of the  
       body is acting.  
      The centre of mass of a body is that point where the whole mass of the body is assumed to  
       be concentrated.  
      A body is said to be in equilibrium if it has no acceleration.  
      A body will be in translational equilibrium only if the vector sum of all the external forces  
       acting on it is equal to zero. This is called first condition of equilibrium. The vector sum of  
       all the torques acting on a body about any axis should be zero. This is second condition of  
       equilibrium.  
      When a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point equals the  
       sum of anticlockwise moments about that point.  
      A body is said to be in a state of stable equilibrium, if after a slight tilt, it comes back to its  
       original position.  
      A body is said to be in a state of unstable equilibrium if, after a slight tilt, it tends to move  
       on further away from its original position.  
      A body is in neutral equilibrium if it comes to rest in its new position after disturbance  
       without any change in its centre of mass.  
      Analogous to Newton's first law of motion in a straight line, a rotating object will continue  
       to do so with constant angular velocity unless acted upon by a resultant moment of force.  
      The  force  that  causes  an  object  to  move  in  a  circle  at  constant  speed  is  called  the  
       centripetal force.
