﻿          Work   and  energy  are   important                                           
concepts in physics as well as in our everyday                                          
life. Commonly the word ‘work’ covers all sort                                          
                                                                                        
of activities whether mental or physical. If a                                          
girl is studying (Fig. 5.1) or a  man is standing                                       
(Fig. 5.2) with a load of bricks on his head, we                                        
say that they are doing work. But according to                                          
physics, work has a specific definition. Work is                                        
                                                                                          Fig. 5.1  
said to be done when a force acts on an object                                          
and moves it through some distance.  
The concept of energy is closely associated with that of  
work,  when  work  is  done  by  one  system  on  another,  
energy is transferred between the two systems.  
           In this chapter, we will define work, energy, power  
and  efficiency  and  show  how  they  are  related  to  one  
another.  

5.1 Work                                                                                            Fig. 5.2  

Force and distance are two essential elements of work. When a constant force  
acting on a body moves it through some distance, we say that 'the force has done  
work'.  
                     Work is defined as the product of magnitude of force  
                     and  the  distance  covered  in  the  direction  of  force.  
                                                                                                      
  

           Consider a block of wood lying on a                                          
table (Fig. 5.3). If we exert a force  F  on the                                        
                                                                                          F                     F  
block to move it through a distance S  in the                                           
direction of force, then the work  W done by                                            

the force is:                                                                                   S  
Work = Magnitude of force × Distance                                                    
                                                                                           Fig. 5.3  
or        W = F × S..................... (5.1)  

From Eq. (5.1), it can be concluded that if some force is  
acting on a body but there is no displacement, then no  
work is done. For example, a man is pushing hard a wall  
but the wall remains fixed in its place. In this case, the man  
is doing no work (Fig. 5.4).  
Similarly, if a force acting on the body is zero and the body  
is moving with uniform velocity, work will be zero.  

          As F = 0        so      W = 0 × S = 0                                                     Fig. 5.4

﻿What  will  be  the  work  done  when  a  force  is                               
                                                                                            F                    F  
acting  on  a  body  making  an  angle  θ with  the                               
                                                                                          θ                    θ  
direction of motion? In this case, work is done  
                                                                                  
due to the component of force which is acting                                  F cosθ  
                                                                                                    S  
along the direction of motion (Fig. 5.5).                                         
                                                                                              Fig. 5.5  
Resolving the force F into its components, we have  

the component F cosθ that acts in the direction of motion. Therefore,  
                                           W = (Fcosθ) S  
                                or        W = FS cos θ …… (5.2)  
If θ is zero, cos 0° = 1, then  
                                         W = FS (1) = FS  
  

This is the case when force and distance covered                                           
are  in  the  same  direction.  Now  if  θ  =  90°,  then   Force                          
                                                                                  F        
cos  90°  =  0  which  means  the  force  has  zero  
                                                                                           
component in the direction of motion. Thus,                                                  θ    90O  
                                                                                           
  
                                                                                                          Displacement  
                                W = FS (0) = 0                                             
                                                                                                                S  
                                                                                           
           This is the case when force is perpendicular                                    
to the displacement. Look at Fig. 5.6, it suggests                                         
that if a person carries a bag to some distance, this  
                                                                                           
work is zero, because the force applied to hold the                                            Fig. 5.6  
load is upward which is perpendicular to the displacement.  

           The work done to push an object is the same whether the object moves  
north to south or east to west, provided the magnitude of force and the distance  
moved are not changed. Work does not convey any directional information, so it  
is a scalar quantity.  

  

Calculation of Work Done by Graph  

           When a constant force F acts through a distance S,                               P                           Q  

the  event  can  be  plotted  on  a  force-distance  graph  as                                     Shaded area  
                                                                                          F  
shown in Fig. 5.7. If the force and distance covered are in                                         work done  
the same direction, the work done is F × S.                                            Force  
                                                                                                 
           Clearly the shaded area in the figure is also F × S.                             O         Dis tance         R  
Hence the area under a force distance curve can be taken                                                  S 
to represent the work done by that force.                                                             Fig. 5.7

﻿Units of Work  
                                                

The SI unit of work is joule (J).  

  

       One joule work is done when a force of one newton acting on a body  
       moves  it  through  a  distance  of  one   metre  in  its  own  direction.  

  

From Eq. (5.1)   
                       1 J = 1 N × 1 m  
            or         1 J = N m  

                                                                    3                                   6  
Bigger units are also used like                        1 kJ = 10 J           and          1MJ = 10 J  

  Example 5.1  

            A person does 200 J of work in pushing a  carton  through  a  distance  of  
5 metres. How much force is applied by him?  

  Solution    

Work done                          W = 200 J  
Distance                           S  =  5 m  
Force                              F  = ?  
                                                                     W  
From Eq. (5.1)                     W  =  F × S         or      F =  
                                                                     S  
Putting the values, we get  
                                          200 J  
                                   F  =               =  40 N  
                                           5 m  
  Example 5.2  

            Find the work done by a 65 N force in pulling the suitcase (Fig. 5.8) for a  
distance of 20 metres.  

  Solution    

Force applied                            F  =  65 N  
Distance covered                         S  =  20 m  
                                                                                                         30O  
Angle from the figure                    θ  =  30o  

Work                                     W =  ?  
Using Eq. 5.2,  
                                                                           o                   Fig. 5.8  
                                         W    =    FS    cos    30 
                                         W = 65 N × 20 m × 0.866  
                                         W =1125.8 N m                 =     1125.8 J

              Our body cannot move unless we have energy

we say that a certain body has energy, we mean that it     
has the ability of doing work.

  Energy can be defined as the ability of a body to do work.                                                             energy, which is  

                                                                                                                  transferred to the arrow  
             When someone does work, energy of the body                                                            as it is shot. Some bows  
has to be spent. In fact, energy is transferred to the body                                                         store  enough energy  
on which work is done. In other words, the energy is                                                               to shot  an  arrow  even

transferred  from  one  system  to  another.  For  example,  
when you do work pushing a swing, chemical energy in your body is transferred  
to the swing and appears as energy of the motion of the swing.  

Like work, energy is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is joule (J).  

  

 When one joule work is done on a body, the amount of energy spent is one joule.  

There are many forms of energy. Electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear  
energy, heat energy and light energy are some well-known forms which we shall  
study later on. There are two basic forms of energy:  
              (i) Kinetic energy  
              (ii) Potential energy  

  

The  combination  of  these  two  types  of  energies  is  called  mechanical  energy.  

  

Kinetic Energy  

  

                                  The kinetic energy of a body is the energy  
                                  that a body possesses by virtue of its motion.  
                                                                                                                             
To find out how much kinetic energy a moving body possesses, an opposite  
force can be applied on the body to stop its motion. Then the work done by  
the  force  will  be  equal  to  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  body.  i.e.,  Kinetic  energy  
(E  ) = Work done (W)

Suppose a body of mass m is moving with velocity v. An opposing force F acting  
on the body through a distance S brings it to rest. Then,

Potential Energy  

              In the previous section, we have seen that the work done on a body is used  
to increase its kinetic energy. Sometimes, the work done on a body does not  
increase its kinetic energy, rather it is stored in the body as potential energy.  
  Potential energy is defined as the energy that a body                                                                Do You Know?

There   are   many   forms   of   potential   energy.   As    

mentioned above, the energy possessed by an object    
by virtue of its position relative to the Earth is known                                                           The train is changing

﻿          The energy stored in a compressed or stretched spring is called elastic  
potential energy and the potential energy in the chemicals of a battery is called  
chemical  potential energy, which is changed to electrical energy by chemical  
reactions. Thermal or internal energy is released by burning fossil fuels i.e. coal,  
oil or gas through chemical reactions.  
          Nuclear energy  is the hidden energy in the nuclei of atoms. When they  
are broken, energy is released in the form of heat and some other radiations. This  
is called nuclear fission.  
          If the block shown in Fig. 5.10 is lifted to a height                                
h  above  the  ground,  then  the  block  would  have                                    F  
potential energy in that raised position. Therefore, it                                               h  

has the ability to do work whenever it is allowed to fall.  
How  should  potential  energy  be  measured?  Because                                         Fig. 5.10  
                                                                                       w  
work is done on the block to put it into the position where it has potential energy,  
therefore, we can say that the work done is stored in it as potential energy. Thus,  
potential energy Ep   is given by  
                    E  = Work done to put the block in elevated position  
                      p  

          The applied force necessary to lift the block with constant velocity is equal  
to weight w of the block and since w  = mg, therefore, potential energy of the  
block at height h becomes,

5.3 Conservation of Energy  

            The study of various forms of energy and the transformation of one kind  
of  energy  into  another  has  led  to  a  very  important  principle  known  as  the  
principle of conservation of energy. Formally, it is stated as:  

  

               Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It may be transformed from  
   one form to another, but the total amount of energy never changes.  

            During energy transfer process, some energy seems to be lost and not  
accounted for in calculations. This loss of energy is due to work done against  
friction of the moving parts in the process. This energy appears as heat and is  
dissipated in the environment. This energy does not remain available for doing  
some useful work and may be called waste energy.  
            A process of energy conversion and conservation can be described with  
the given example.  
            Let a  body of  mass m  be  at  rest  at  a  point A above the  
                                                                                                                   A      
height h from the ground (Fig.5.12). Its total energy is P.E is  mgh,  
                                                                                                                 
                                                E  = mgh                                                                      

                                                  p  
and                                             E  = 0                                                           

                                                  k  
                                                                                                                   B                h  
Then the body is allowed to drop to point B at a height x from the

                                                  p  

The loss of potential energy will appear as the gain in kinetic energy, hence, at  
point B  
                                                E = mgx  
                                                  k  

            Total energy at B                   E = mg (h − x) + mgx  =  mgh  
Just  before  hitting  the  ground  at  point  C,  the  whole  of  potential  energy  is  
changed into kinetic energy. Thus,  
                                    E  = 0   and            E = mgh  
                                      p 
            Thus, total energy remains the same as mgh. On hitting the ground, this     

energy is dissipated as heat and sound in the environment.

﻿Solar Energy  
                                              
             Sun is the biggest source of energy. The energy obtained from sunlight is  
referred to as solar energy. Solar energy can be used in two ways. Either it can be  
used for heating system or can be converted to electricity. In one way, solar  
panels absorb heat of the Sun. They consist of large metal plates which are  
painted black (Fig. 5.15). Heat can be used for warming houses or running water  
heating system. If solar radiation is concentrated to a small surface area by using  
large reflectors or lenses, reasonably high temperature can be achieved.

To make use of the heat of the rocks, two  
holes are drilled up to the rocks. Cold water  
is pumped down through one of the holes. It  
is  heated  up  by  the  hot  rocks  and  starts  
boiling. Steam is produced that comes out  
through the other hole. The steam runs the  
generator which produces electricity. Where

             For thousands of years, people have  
been using windmills to draw water from the  
well or to grind grains into flour. The modern  
windmill  is  used  to  run  generators  that  
produce electricity. Wind  generators make  
electricity in the same way as steam generators  
in  power  stations.  For  large  scale  power  
generation, a 'wind farm' with a  hundred or  
more windmills is  needed. A windmills farm

Energy from Tides  
                                              
             The gravitational force for the moon gives rise to tides in the seas. The tide  
raises the water level near the sea shore twice a day. The rise and fall of water can  
be utilized to turn on turbine for electricity generation. The water at  high tides  
can be trapped at a suitable location, a basin,   by building a dam. The water is  
then released in a controlled way at low tide to drive the turbines for producing  
electricity. At next high tide, the dam is filled again and the incoming water also  
drives turbines.  

  

Energy from Waves in Sea  

             The tides and winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce strong  
water waves.  

             Their energy can be used to generate                                   Duck floats                            Balance float

energy is to use large floats which move up  
and down with the waves. One such device  
invented by Prof. Salter is known as Salter's

generation of hydroelectric power will never end up. Likewise, solar energy will  
remain available forever. Same is the case with wind and tidal energy. These are  
not going to run out in future.  
Non-renewable sources include fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The remnants of  
plants and animals buried under the Earth took millions of years to change into  
fossil fuels. These fuels are in limited quantity. Once they are used up, it will take  
further millions of years to form new ones. Similarly, fuels for the nuclear energy  
are also limited.  
As the need for energy is increasing day by day, there is need to develop other  
non- traditional renewable energy sources.  

  

5.6 The Advantages and Disadvantages  
of methods of Energy production  

  

                                                                        

The   production   of   hydroelectric  
power  is  more  economical  and  
pollution free. The solar power, wind,  
tidal  and  wave  power  need  more  
initial cost but they do not produce  
pollution and are also economical as  
well.   On   the   other   hand,   power  
generation by fossil fuels and nuclear  
fuel   adds   to   the   pollution  of

Wind-mills are very noisy. Some people think that wind turbines spoil the beauty  
of landscape.  
             Nuclear power generators are also run by steam produced by nuclear  
heat energy. Heat itself is a form of pollution. Moreover, there is always danger of  
leakage of the radioactive radiation which is harmful to living bodies. People  
living around  nuclear plants are always at risk. The disposal of nuclear waste is  
another problem for the nuclear power generation. However, any form of waste  
energy ends up as thermal energy that goes to the environment. Thus, thermal  
pollution is increasing day by day causing global warming.  

                                                                        118  
  
﻿5.7 Power  
                              
           In many cases, the time to do work is as important as the amount of work  
done. Suppose you walk up to a height ‘h’ through upstairs (Fig. 5.26). You do  
work, because you are lifting your body up the stairs. If you run up, you can reach  
the same height in a shorter time interval.  

                                             
                                             
                                             
                                             

                                             
                                                                          height (h)  

                                                           Fig. 5.26  

The work done is the same in either case, because the net result is that you lifted  
up the same weight w to the same height h. But you know that if you run up the  
stairs, you would be more tired than you walked up slowly. In fact, there is a  
difference in the rate at which work is done. We say that you expend more energy  
when you go up the stairs rapidly than when you go slowly.  
The concept of power can also be explained with another example of an electric  
motor or a water pump. A bigger motor draws more water during the same  
interval of time as compared to a smaller one. It is said that the power of bigger  
motor is greater than that of smaller one.  

  

                           Power is defined as the time rate of doing work.

﻿Units of Power  
                                   
           Since both work and time are scalar quantities, so according to Eq.(5.5)  
power is also a scalar quantity. The SI unit of powers is watt (W).  

  

               One watt is the work done at the rate of one joule per second.

It is found that the energy output is always less than the energy input. During any  
conversion of energy, some energy is wasted in the form of heat. No device has  
yet been invented that may convert all the input energy into required output.  
That is why a system cannot have an efficiency of 100 %. As the energy losses are  
inevitable in the working of a machine, hence, an ideal or perpetual machine  
cannot be constructed.  
   Perpetual Energy Machines    

         It is a hypothetical machine that  can do work indefinitely, without any  
external source of energy. A perpetual machine would have to generate more  
energy than it consumes, effectively producing energy from nothing, which is  
impossible. In any real mechanical system, some energy is always lost as heat due  
to  friction  between  moving  parts  and  air  resistance  etc.  Thus,  making  it  
impossible for a machine to keep moving without an external source of energy.  
Infact,  it  is  a  consequence  of  the  principle  of  conservation  of  energy  that  a  
perpetual energy machine is not workable.

﻿  Example 5.6    

A block weighing 120 N is dragged up a slope with a force of 100 N to lift it up a  
height of 10 m. If the slope is 20 m long, calculate the efficiency of the system.  

  Solution    
Weight of block                    W =  120 N  
Force applied                     F  =  100 N  
Distance                          S  =  20 m  
                                                                                                                           10 m  
Height                            h  =  10 m  
% Efficiency                           =  ?  
Work done to lift the block up is:  
                       W = F × S = 100 N × 20 m = 2000 J  
Now, total input energy = work done on the block = 2000 J
