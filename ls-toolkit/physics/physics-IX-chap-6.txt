﻿             You have learnt in lower classes that every thing around us is made up of  
matter. The matter normally exists in solid, liquid and  gaseous states. These  
states are due to attractive force that exist between the atoms and molecules. We  
have already studied some basic properties of matter. In this chapter, we will  
discuss mechanical properties of matter that are of vital importance for use of a  
material for various useful purposes in technology and engineering. The main  
contents included in this chapter are: deformation of solids due to some applied  
force, density and pressure.  

  

  6.1 Deformation of solids                                                                       
                                                                                                  
            We have observed that an external force applied   
on an object can change its size or shape. Such a force is   
known as deforming force. For example, an appropriate   
force applied to a spring can increase its  length called   
extension  or  cause  compression  thus  reducing  its   
length. If this force is removed, the spring will restore its   
original size and shape. Similarly, stretched rubber strip   
                                                                                                  
or  band  comes  to  its  original  shape  and  size  on   
removing the applied force.  
                                                                                                  
When a tennis ball is hit by a racket, the shapes of tennis                                                   Fig. 6.1

(Fig.  6.1).  They  regain  their  original  shape  after  
                                                                                                For Your Information!

be elastic, if after removal of the deforming force, it  
                                                                                                 clay  dough  or  plasticine

we can determine the strength of a material and the                                              r  e  m  o  v  a  l  o  f  t  h  e  
deformation produced under the action of a force.                                                deforming         force.     They

limit known as elastic limit. Beyond the elastic limit, the  
change becomes permanent. The object or material does not regain its original  
shape or size even after the removal of the deforming force.  

  

  6.2  Hooke’s law  

            If force F is applied on a spring to stretch or compress it, the extension or  
compression x has been found directly proportional to the applied force within  
the elastic limit. Thus,                     F ∝ x                                          F .............  
                       or                    F = kx                       or        k  =                    (6.1)  
                                                                                           x

﻿where k is the constant of proportionality and is known as spring constant. In fact,  
it is a measure of stiffness of the spring. The greater the value of spring constant,  
the  greater  will  be  the  stiffness  or  strength  of  the  
                                  -1                                                                                   A  
spring. Its unit is N m .                                                                                               Elastic limit  
            A graph of force against extension is a straight  
line passing through the origin.  If the applied force or                                         F  
load  exceeds  the  elastic  limit  of  the  spring,  it  is                                     (N)  
permanently  deformed  and  its  graph  will  no  longer                                             O            x  
remain linear. The gradient or slope of force-extension                                                          (m)  
graph is a measure of spring constant k.

            Hooke’s law also holds when a force is applied to a straight thin wire or a  
rubber band within its elastic limit.  

  

  Activity 6.1  

             The teacher will arrange a helical spring with an  
 attached  pointer,  slotted  weights,  half  metre  rule  or  
  scale, iron stand and will facilitate to perform this activity  
  as per instructions. Note that a spring of helical or spiral  
  shape is called helical spring. Its length should be greater  
 than its diameter.  
  (i)        Suspend a helical spring with the stand.  
  (ii)       Adjust the pointer so that it does not touch the  
             scale but can move up and down freely along  
             the scale.  
  (iii)      Place a slotted weight say 50 g in the hanger and  
             note the position of pointer on the scale.  
  (iv)       Repeat   this   step   for   five   times,   each   time  
             increasing the load in equal amount.  
  (v)        Draw a graph between force F along y-axis and  
             extension along x-axis.  
  (vi)       What is the shape of the graph?  
  (vii)      What does it show?  
  (viii)     Find the slope of the straight line. What does it  
             represent?

                                                                 129  
  
﻿Applications of Hooke's Law  
                                                             
          Hooke's law serves as the basic principle in wide range of applications. In  
the field of technology and engineering, springs in many devices rely on Hooke's  
law for their functions such as spring scales, balance wheel of the mechanical  
clocks,  galvanometer,  suspensions  system  in  vehicles  and  motorbikes,  door  
hinges, mattresses, material testing machines, etc.  
          However,  Hooke's  law  applies  within  a  
specific range of forces. Exceeding the range or  
limit  results  in  permanent  deformation  and  no  
longer follows Hooke's law. Some of the uses are  
elaborated below:  
1.  Spring scales

compression of a spring to determine the weight  
of  objects.  In  a  common  spring  balance  the                                               Balancing  
                                                                                                  spring  
extension or elongation produced is a measure of  
                                                                        
the weight.  In compression  balance, the spring is  
compressed   by  the   load  (force)  and  the    
                                                                                               Fig. 6.4  
compression produced is measured by means of a  
pointer moving over a scale. Weighing machine usually use this type of balance.  
2.   Balance wheel of mechanical clocks  
     The balance wheel in mechanical clocks use spring to control the back and  
forth motion that regulates the speed of the hands of a clock (Fig. 6.4).  
3. Galvanometer  
                                                                       
          Galvanometer          is  a    current     detecting         
device. It makes use of a tiny spring called hair                      
                                                                       
spring      (Fig.   6.5)    which      provides       electrical       
connections to the galvanometer coil and also                          
restores the pointer back to zero position. The                         

deflection of the pointer is proportional to the                       
current flowing through it within the range.

          If  you  take  equal  volumes  of  different                             Fig. 6.5

﻿find that each of them has a different mass. That is, one centimetre cube of wood  
may weigh only 0.7 g but made of iron will weigh 8.0 g. Why is it so? You know  
that  all  substances  are  composed  of  molecules.  The  molecules  of  different  
substances are different in size and mass. The inter-molecular spacing is also  
different.  
         The mass of equal volume of various substances actually is the mass of the  
total  number  of  molecules  present  in  that  volume.  Naturally,  the  substance  
whose molecules are densely packed and also which are heavy will weigh more  
than others.  
            Density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

6.5 Pressure in Liquids  

            We  have  learnt  in  the  lower  classes  that  liquids  exert  pressure  in  all  
directions. Moreover, liquid pressure increases with depth.  
            Let us determine the pressure at a certain depth of a liquid. Figure. 6.8  
shows a container of liquid. Consider an area A in the liquid at depth h. The force  
acting on this area is equal to the weight of the liquid column over surface A . The  
volume of this liquid is    V  = Ah . If ρ is the density of liquid, then mass m of the  
liquid column will be:  
                                   m = ρ V = ρAh  

                                                                 133  
  
﻿Therefore, force acting on area A will be  
F    =    mg    =    ρ    Ahg  
The pressure P at area A will be,  
                                    F         ρAhg

liquid increases with depth. The value of pressure                                             A         
depends on the depth and density of the liquid.  
           Pressure produces force at right angle to  
the  surface.  A  force  or  its  component  that  is  
parallel  to  the  surface,  does  not  contribute  to  
pressure.  The  pressure,  by  definition,  is  only                           Fig. 6.8 Pressure in a liquid  

contributed by the normal component of the force. That is, the forces in a liquid  
that push directly against the surface and add up to a net force is perpendicular  
to the surface.  If there is a hole in the surface of the liquid container, the liquid  
spurts at right angle to the surface before curving downward due to gravity.

  i.    Make three small holes at different heights in the side of a  
        container as shown in the given figure.  
  ii.   Fill the container with water.  
  iii.  Observe the water streams flowing out of the holes. It is  
        initially normal to the surface.  
  iv.  Which  one  of  the  streams  hits  the  ground  at  larger  
        distance?  
  v.   At which position the liquid has more pressure?  
  You will observe that the stream from each hole, initially flows out normal to the surface before  
  curving down due to gravity and the lowest hole has more pressure. It shows that liquid pressure  
  increases with depth.

  (ii)        Poke several holes by using a pin on the bag.  
  (iii)       Squeeze the bag gently.  
  (iv)        What do you observe?  
              Squeezing the top of bag causes the water to squirt on  
  in all directions. It means the pressure is transmitted equally  
 throughout the liquid.  

6.6 Atmospheric Pressure  

             The Earth is surrounded by a layer of air which we call atmosphere. We  
know that air is a  mixture of gases. Their  molecules are always in  motion. They  
collide with one another and with all other objects coming in their way. Thus, they  
exert force on the objects. This force per unit area is the atmospheric pressure.  
Since the molecules of air have random motion, therefore, atmospheric pressure  
acts equally in all directions.  

       The  atmosphere  exerts  pressure  on  the  surface  of  the  Earth  and  on  
       everything  on  the  Earth.  This  pressure  is  called  atmospheric  pressure.  

                                                                      135

height of about 100 kilometres. The density of air is                               The pressure of 1 atmosphere

           We live at the bottom of the Earth's atmosphere which is a fluid that exerts  

pressure on our bodies. At sea level, the value of atmospheric pressure is about  
                 5  Pa. This value is referred to as standard atmospheric pressure. It is an  
1.013 × 10 

enormous  pressure  which  can  crush  anything.  We  do  not  feel  it  because  

practically all the bodies have air inside them. As atmospheric pressure acts in all  

directions, so it balances the pressure inside.  

  

Evidence of Atmospheric Pressure  

           We can observe the force of the atmospheric pressure if we remove the  

inside air from a vessel as shown in the following activity.

            The teacher should perform this activity in the  
 class following the instructions given.  
             Boil some water in a tin can. When it is full of  
 steam, remove it from the burner and close its mouth by  
 an air tight cork. Then pour cold water over it. The can  
 crumples as shown in the given figure. Why does the tin  
 crumples?  

  

Variation of Atmospheric Pressure with Height  

           We have studied that pressure in a liquid increases with depth. At depth h,  
the pressure of liquid is given by  

                      P = ρgh  

           This formula is applicable to all the fluids. As the gases of the atmosphere  
are also fluid, therefore, the atmospheric pressure should be maximum on the  
ground at sea level. As we go up in the air, atmospheric pressure decreases. At a  
height of about 5 km, it falls to 55 kPa and at a height of 30 km it falls to 1 kPa. By  
measuring the atmospheric pressure at a point in air, altitude of that point can be  
determined. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the greater is the altitude.

            Atmospheric  pressure  depends  upon  the  
density of air. At high altitudes, where the air is less dense, the atmospheric  
pressure falls down. Similarly, increase in the quantity of water vapours also  
decreases  the  density.  Thus,  atmospheric  pressure  becomes  low  in  cloudy  
regions. Weather casters use this knowledge to predict rains. A fall in pressure  
often means that rain clouds are on the way and the rain is to follow.  

6.8 Measurement of Pressure by Manometer  

            A   simple   manometer   consists   of   a  
U-shaped glass tube which contains mercury. In    
the beginning, the atmospheric pressure at the    
two  open  ends  of  the  tube  is  the  same  and    
                                                                                          
hence,  mercury  level  in  the  two  arms  remains  
                                                                                          
same (Fig. 6.10).  If on connecting a gas cylinder    
with short arm keeping the longer arm of the    
tube  open,  the  mercury  level  in  short  arm  is    
lower than that in the  long arm (Fig. 6.11), then    
                                                                                          
the   unknown  pressure  is  more  than  the

short arm is more than the long arm (Fig.6.12),                                                   Fig. 6.10 manometer

atmospheric pressure.

           Let us perform a very interesting activity with a liquid. Take water in a flask   

with piston and having a few side tubes fixed at different positions. If such flask is  
not available you can join  a syringe at the mouth of a pet bottle. For side tubes,  
bendable transparent drinking straws can be glued on the holes punched on  
sides of the bottle.  
          You will observe that the level of water in all the side tubes is the same. This  
is because a liquid seeks its own level and rises to  
the same height at all points. Now push the piston                                 Piston                     Side  
through some distance.                                                                                        tubes  

          The level of water in all the side tubes rises  
to the same height. Why does this happen? This is  
because the pressure applied at one point of the  
liquid is transmitted equally to every point of the  
liquid. Since gases (air) and liquids are termed as  
fluids so the above activities prove that:  

  

           When pressure is applied at one point in  
            an   enclosed   fluid,   it   is   transmitted                    Flask                        Water  
            equally to all parts of fluid without loss.                                    Fig. 6.13  

This is the statement of Pascal's law.  
          The technology of hydraulic systems is based on Pascal's law. Its main  
advantages are:  
(I)        Liquids do not absorb any of the supplied energy.  
(ii)      They are capable of moving much heavy loads and providing great forces  
           due to incompressibility.

            Consider  a  specially  designed  container  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.14.  In  this  
container there are two cylinders joined  by means of a pipe. The cross-sectional  
area of the smaller cylinder is A 1                             F 
                                                                 1  

and that of the larger one is A  .

The cylinders are filled with some  
incompressible liquid.  
Suppose that the small  piston  is                                  Piston

transmitted equally to the large  
piston.                                                                     Pipe                                  Liquid  

Due to this pressure P, a force F ,

  Putting the value of P,

            Since A₂  > A , therefore, F₂  > F₁. The result indicates that a small force  
                                  1 

applied on the smaller piston, results into a large force on the larger piston. Such  
a system is known as force multiplier.  
            A hydraulic press works on this principle. Cotton bale or any other object  
to be compressed is placed over the larger piston. A force F₁  is applied on the  
smaller piston. The pressure P produced by smaller piston is transmitted equally  
to the larger piston. A much greater  
                                                               
force F  acts on it. This force lifts the

cotton bale.                                                   
            This principle is also used at    
service   stations   to   lift   cars   for

﻿equally to all the larger pistons of other cylinders. This pressure causes these  
pistons to move outward pressing the brake pads towards brake discs or brake  
drums.  Force of friction between the pads and discs or drums slows down the  
vehicle. When pressure is released from the pedal, the springs pull back the brake

             shape when deforming force ceases to act.  

            Within the elastic limit of a helical spring, the extension or compression in it is  
             directly proportional to the applied force. This is known as Hooke's law.  

            Density is defined as mass per unit volume.  
            Pressure is the force that acts normally on unit area of a surface. Its SI unit is  

                                 -2  
             pascal = 1 N m 

            Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the atmosphere acting on unit area  
             of the Earth’s surface.  

            Atmospheric  pressure  is  measured  by  the  column  of  mercury  which  the  
             atmospheric pressure can support.  

            If pressure is exerted on a liquid, the liquid transmits it equally in all directions.  
             This is known as Pascal's law.
