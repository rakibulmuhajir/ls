          Heat or thermal energy has always been the necessity of human beings,  
animals and plants in this world. Without heat, their existence would not have  
been possible.  In the beginning, the Sun was the only source of light and heat.  
With the discovery of fire, a new era was started. The uses of heat produced from  
fire were increased day by day and contributed greatly to the comforts and  
facilities for the human being. Initially, the hot and cold objects were sensed by  
touching which was not a good standard to measure the degree of hotness of an

﻿object. So, man evolved different methods to measure it. After the invention of  
standard measuring devices, the temperature was also included in the list of  
basic physical quantities like mass, length and time.  
           This chapter begins with the introduction of kinetic molecular theory of  
particles of matter. It is due to the fact that temperature and heat or internal  
energy are associated with the motion of particles in the matter.  

  

7.1 Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter  

           According to this theory, matter is composed of very small particles called  
molecules  which  are  always  in  motion.  Their  motion  may  be  vibrational,  
rotational  or  linear.  There  exists  a  mutual  force  of  attraction  between  the  
molecules known as intermolecular force. This force depends upon the distance  
between the molecules. It decreases with increasing distance between them.  
           The molecules possess kinetic energy due to motion and potential energy  
due to force of attraction. When a substance is heated, its temperature rises and  
its molecular motion becomes more vigorous which increases the kinetic energy  
of the molecules. Thus, the temperature of the substance depends upon the  
average kinetic energy of its molecules. In general, matter exists in three states  
solids, liquids and gases as shown in Fig. 7.1.  

                                Solid                       Liquid                     Gas  
                                                                                                     
                                                            Fig. 7.1                           
           Most of the properties of solids, liquids and gases  
can be explained on the basis of kinetic molecular theory of  
matter. In case of solids, the intermolecular forces are so  
strong  that  they  keep  the  molecules  bound.  So,  the  
molecules are held at fixed positions but still they show  
vibrational motion about their fixed points (Fig. 7.2). This is  
why, the solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.  
           In case of liquids, intermolecular force is so weak that                                                            
it  cannot  hold  the  molecules  at  fixed  positions  and  the                                        Fig. 7.2  
molecules  can  slide  over  each  other  in  random  directions. A  liquid, therefore,  
possesses  a  definite  volume  but  has  no  definite  shape.  Due  to  flow  of  the  
molecules, it acquires the shape of the containing vessel.  
           Gas molecules are relatively far away from one and another. Due to which,  
gas neither posseses a definite volume nor a definite shape.  

                                                            149  
  
﻿ Plasma  
                          
              The plasma is a gas in which most of the atoms   
are  ionized  containing  positive  ions  and  electrons   
(Fig. 7.3-a). They are freely moving in the volume of the   
gas. Due to presence of positive ions and free electrons,   
                                                                                                                 
plasma  is  the  conducting  state  of  matter.  It  allows  
                                                                                                                 
electric  current  to  pass  through  it.  Since  the  gas  in   
plasma state has properties which are quite different  
                                                                                                                 
from ordinary gas, therefore, plasma is known as fourth                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       Fig. 7.3(a) Plasma  
                                                                                                                   
state of matter. The Sun and the most of other stars are in plasma state. Plasma is  
also found in plasma TV and in gas discharge tubes (Fig. 7.3-b) when electric  
current passes through them. The plasma state also occurs during the early  
stages  of  lightning  formation  known  as  lightning  streamers  which  are  the  
conducting paths through the atmosphere due to ionized air molecules.

7.2  Temperature and Heat  

              When we touch ice, we feel cold. When we dip                                                                                    Ice cubes  
our fingers in warm water, we feel hot. Thus, by sense of  
touch we can tell which of the bodies is colder or hotter.  
A hotter body is said to be at higher temperature as  
compared to a colder body.  
                Temperature of a body is defined as degree  
                           of its hotness or coldness.  
                                                                                                            
              It is our common experience that when we heat a  
body, its temperature rises. Process of heating provides  
heat or thermal energy to the body which is the cause                                                                                    Warm water  
of the rise in temperature.                                                                                                    Fig. 7.4  
              The following activity will help to define temperature.  
  Activity 7.1  

   The teacher should arrange hot water in some tea cups, thermometers and metal spoons.  
    Make groups of the students. Each group will put the spoon in the hot water and stir it. Ask  
   them what do they feel. Does the other end of the spoon also become hot?  

                                                                              150  

  
﻿   Do they observe that the spoon also gets hotter? It means heat is being transferred from the  
   hot water to the spoon because the temperature of the water was higher than that of the  
   spoon.  
   Thus  
                    Temperature can be defined as a physical quantity which  
                         determines the direction of flow of thermal energy.  
  
            This means that thermal energy is transferred from one object to another  
due to temperature difference of the two bodies. Therefore, we can define heat  
as follows:  

        Heat is the energy which is transferred from one object to another due to  
       difference of temperature between the two bodies.  

  

Temperature and Internal Energy  

  

          We know that matter is composed  
of   molecules   which   are   always   in  
motion.  Molecules  of  a  solid  are  
vibrating  about  their  fixed  positions.  
The  molecules  of  a  liquid  are  sliding  
one over the other and those of gases  
are  randomly  moving.  The  molecules  
                                                                                                                                              
possess  kinetic  energy  on  account  of                                      Fig. 7.5 The internal energy of air

associated with molecules  because of                                         the temperature increases.  

their attractive forces.  
                           The sum of kinetic and potential energies of the  
                         molecules of an object is called its internal energy.  
                                                                                                                         

            When we heat a substance, its molecular motion becomes more vigorous  
which means an increase in its internal energy. As a result, temperature of the  
substance rises. The heat energy transferred to a body increases the internal  
energy of its molecules due to which its temperature rises.  
             Remember that, it is not true to say that a substance contains heat. The  
substance contains internal energy. The word heat is used only when referring to  
the energy actually in transit from hot to cold body.  

  

7.3 Thermometers  

            Our sense of touch can tell us whether an object is hot or cold. It gives an  
idea  about  the  object's  temperature  but  we  cannot  measure  the  actual  

                                                                    151  
  
﻿temperature of the body just  by touching it. For the exact measurement of the  
hotness of a substance, we require an instrument called a thermometer.  
           Thermometers  use  some  property  of  a  substance,  which  changes  
appreciably with the change of temperature.  

Basic Thermometric Properties  

           Some basic thermometric properties for a material suitable to construct  
a thermometer are the following:  
1.         It is a good conductor of heat.  
2.         It gives quick response to temperature changes.  
3.         It has uniform thermal expansion.  
4.         It has high boiling point.  
5.         It has low freezing point.  
6.         It has large expansivity (low specific heat capacity).  
7.         It does not wet glass.  
8.         It does not vapourize.  
9.         It is visible.  
Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer  
  
           We know that liquids expand on heating. So, expansion in the volume of a  
liquid  can  be  used  for  the  measurement  of  temperature.  This  is  known  as  
liquid-in-glass  thermometer.  One  such  liquid  which  is  commonly  used  in  
thermometers is mercury. Figure 7.6 shows a mercury thermometer. It is made of  
glass. It has a bulb at one end filled with mercury.

           When the temperature rises, the mercury expands and moves up through  
the narrow capillary tube in the form of a mercury thread. As shown in the given  
figure 7.6, the position of the end of thread reads the temperature. Mercury is  
opaque and can be easily seen due to its silvery colour. Alcohol is also a choice for  
the thermometric liquid, but it must be coloured to make it visible.

﻿of a substance cease to move. Their average kinetic energy becomes zero. This is  
known as absolute zero. Its value is -273.15 °C. For calculations, it is simply taken  
as -273 °C. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature even to be in the  
whole universe. The matter does not exist below absolute zero temperature.

 reference, the temperature of other junction at a higher temperature can be  
 measured using a millivolt meter by a calibrated scale on it (Fig. 7.8).  
            This type of thermometer is particularly useful for very high temperatures  
and also rapidly changing temperature as there is only a small mass of metal  
 (the junction) to heat up.  

7.4 Sensitivity, Range and Linearity of Thermometers  

            A  thermometer  is  evaluated  by  its  three  key  characteristics  that  are  
sensitivity,  range  and  linearity.  They  help  determine  the  suitability  of  the  
thermometer for specific use ensuring accurate and reliable measurement of  
temperature.  

  

Sensitivity  

            Sensitivity of a thermometer refers to its ability to detect small changes in  
the temperature of an object. For example, the minimum division on the scale of  
a thermometer is  1°C. The accuracy of its temperature measurement will be  1°C.  
On another thermometer the marks are 0.1°C apart. Hence, its accuracy will be  
 up to 0.1°C and said to be more sensitive. Its measurement will be more precise  
than the measurement by a thermometer with an accuracy of 1°C.  

  

Range  

            This refers to the span of temperature, from low to high, over which the  
thermometer  can  measure  accurately.  For  example,  a  clinical  thermometer  
designed for human body temperature has a narrow or short range, say from  
 35°C to 45°C. A long-range thermometer is usually used for science experiments  
 in the  laboratory with  markings from − 10°C to  110°C. The choice of  liquid for  

                                                                155  
  
﻿thermometers put a lower and upper limit for the range of a thermometer.  For  
example, Mercury freezes at -39°C and boils at 357°C. Hence, we can construct  
mercury in glass thermometers within this range. The marking scale depends on  
desired range of measurement. For extremely low temperatures, alcohol is used.  
Alcohol has a much lower freezing point about -112°C which increases its lower  
limit for the range but it has lower upper limit as it boils at 78 °C.  

  

Linearity  

            This refers to a direct proportional relationship between the temperature  
and  scale  reading  across  entire  range  of  measurement.  A  good  linear  
thermometer should measure equal increments on the scale corresponding to  
equal change in the temperature. It means that marking on the scale should be  
evenly spaced over the whole range. High linearity means more consistent and  
proportional  scale  readings  over  the  entire  range  to  ensure  accuracy  of  
measurement.  

  

7.5 Structure of A Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer  

            A liquid-in-glass thermometer has a narrow and uniform capillary tube  
having a small bulb filled with mercury or alcohol at its lower end. The thin wall of  
the glass bulb allows quick conduction through glass to the liquid from a hot  
object whose temperature is to be measured. Mercury being metal is a good  
conductor and hence responds quickly to the change in temperature. The small  
amount of liquid also responds more quickly to a change in temperature. The  
quick response makes the device sensitive. Use of mercury is quite sensitive for  
normal  measurements.  For  greater  accuracy,  alcohol  can  be  used  as  its  
expansivity is six times more than mercury but it has range limitation to higher  
temperature measurements due to its low boiling point (78°C).  
            The uniformity of the narrow tube or bore ensures even expansion of the  
liquid required to make the linear measuring scale. The choice of mercury allows  
to use it over a  long-range temperature due to its  low freezing  point and  high  
boiling point. It provides a fairly long range of measurement of temperature.
