        We are living in a physical world where we observe many natural
phenomena and objects around us such as Sun, stars, moon, oceans, plants,
winds, rains, etc. People have always been curious to know the reality of such
happenings. This has led certain people to investigate the facts and laws working
in this world. This field of observation and experimentation to understand about
the world around us is known as science. Everything in our lives is closely linked
to science and the discoveries made by the scientists. In order to obtain reliable
results from experiments, the primary thing is to make accurate measurements.
        Physical quantities and their measurements have always been the matter
of interest for the scientists. They have been investigating to improve the
methods and instruments for accurate measurements of the physical quantities.
In this chapter, we will discuss physical quantities, their measurements and
related contents.


1.1 Physical and Non-Physical Quantities

       We describe various natural phenomenon, events and human behaviour
using some of their features and terms such as love, affection, fear, wisdom,
beauty, length, volume, density, time, temperature, etc. Some of these can be
measured directly and indirectly using some tools and                         Quick Quiz

instruments such as length of an object using a ruler, time
                                                                            quantity has
duration of an event using a clock, the temperature (the                    dimensions?
degree of hotness) of somebody using a thermometer.
They are called physical quantities. The foundation of physics rests upon physical
quantities through which the laws and principles of physics are expressed.
       Other quantities quoted above such as love, affection, fear, wisdom, and
beauty cannot be measured using tools and instruments. They often pertain to
the perception or interpretation of the observer. They can be described or

qualitatively or compared using some pre-determined criteria, indices or
through survey techniques. Non-physical quantities mostly help to understand
and to analyse human behaviour, emotions and social interactions.

1.2 Base and Derived Physical Quantities
       Physics is a science of physical world where we interact with many
different types of material objects. These objects are exposed in terms of their
measurable features known as physical quantities such as length, breadth,
thickness, mass, volume, density, time, temperature, etc. Out of these, the
scientists have selected arbitrarily some quantities to play a key role. They are
called base quantities. All the quantities which can be described in terms of one
or more base quantities are called derived physical quantities. For example,
speed is a derived quantity which depends on distance and time which are base
quantities whereas density of a material is described in terms of mass and
volume.
Measurement of a Physical Quantity
       A measurement is a process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a
widely accepted standard quantity.
   Activity 1.1
  The teacher should facilitate this activity and initiate discussion as per direction.
  One student should measure the length of a writing board with his hand. The same should
  be repeated by four or five students. Are all the measurements same? If they differ, then
  why? What is the solution to avoid confusion?

                                             7
        In the early days people used to measure length using hand or arm, foot
or steps. This measurement may result in confusion as the measurement of
different people may differ from
each other because of different
sizes of their hands, arms or steps.
To avoid such confusion, there is a
need of a standard so that
measurement by any person may
result the same. This standard of
measurement is known as a unit.

 A measurement consists of two
 parts, a number and a unit. A
 measurement without unit is
 meaningless.

Not very far in the past, every
country in the world had its own
units of measurements. However,
                                           The International Prototype kilogram
problems were faced when people
of different countries exchanged scientific information or traded with other
countries using different units. Eventually, people got the idea of standardizing
the units of measurements which could be used by all countries for efficient
working and growth of mutual trade, business and share scientific information.

SI Prefixes
       The SI is a decimal system. Prefixes are used to write units by powers of 10.
The big quantities like 50000000 m and small quantities like 0.00004 m are not
convenient to write down. The use of prefixes makes them simple. The quantity
50000000 m can be written as 5 × 10 m. Similarly, the quantity 0.00004 m can be
                                      7


written as 4 × 10 m.
                  −5


       Prefixes are the words or symbols added before SI unit such as milli,
centi, kilo, mega, giga (Table1.4). The prefixes given in Table 1.4 should be
known for use of SI units effectively. For example, one thousandth (1/1000) of
a metre is millimetre. The thickness of a thin wire can be expressed
conveniently in millimetres whereas a long distance is expressed in kilometres
which is 1000 metres.
       Multiples and sub-multiples of mass measurement are given in Table 1.5
whereas multiples and sub-multiples of length are given in Table 1.6. The
following examples will explain the meaning of prefixes.

Micrometer Screw Gauge
        It is used to measure very small lengths such as diameter of a wire or
thickness of a metal sheet. It has two scales:
(a)     The main scale on the sleeve which has markings of 0.5 mm each.
(b)     The circular scale on the thimble which has 50 divisions. Some
        instruments may have main scale marking of 1 mm and 100 divisions on
        the thimble.
        When the thimble makes one complete turn, the spindle moves 0.5 mm
(1 scale division) on the main scale which is called pitch of the screw gauge. Thus,
its least count is:

1.6 Mass Measuring Instruments
Physical Balance
         There are many kinds of balances used
for measuring mass of an object. In our daily
life, we use the term weight instead of mass. In
Physics, they have different meanings. Mass is
the measure of quantity of matter in a body
whereas the weight is the force by which the
body is attracted towards the Earth. Weight
                                                                       Fig. 1.8
can be measured using spring balance
(Fig. 1.8). The mass of an object is found by
comparing it with known standard masses.
This process is called weighing. In laboratories,
we use physical balance shown in Fig. 1.9
which is based on the principle of levers. The
process of measurement is given below:
1. Level base of the balance using levelling
     screws until the plumb line is exactly above
                                                                        Fig. 1.9
     the pointed mark.
2. Turn the knob so that the pans of the balance are raised up. Is the beam
   horizontal and pointer at the centre of the scale? If not, turn the balancing
   screws on the beam so that it becomes horizontal.
3. Place the object to be weighed on the left pan.
4. Place the known weight from the weight box in the right pan using forceps.
5. Adjust the weight so that pointer remains on zero or oscillates equally on
   both sides of the zero of the scale.
6. The total of standard masses (weights) is a measure of the mass of the object
   in the left pan.

1.7 Time Measuring Instruments
Stopwatch
         The duration of time of an event is measured
by a stopwatch as shown in Fig. 1.10. It contains two Fig. 1.10 Mechanical Stopwatch
needles, one for seconds and other for minutes. The
dial is divided usually into 30 big divisions each being
further divided into 10 small divisions. Each small
division represents one tenth (1/10) of a second. Thus,
one tenth of a second is the least count of this            Fig. 1.11 Digital Stopwatch

stopwatch. While using, a knob present on the top of the device is pressed. This
results in the starting of the watch. The same knob is again pushed to stop it. After
noting the reading, the same knob is again pressed to bring back the needles to
the zero position. Now-a-days, electronic/digital watches (Fig. 1.11) are also
available which can measure one hundredth part of a second.
 Activity 1.5 Model of a sandclock
 The teacher should arrange the required articles and help students to make a
 model of a sandclock as shown in the figure. Using two glass funnels, adhesive
 tape, two lids, and dry sand. Observe how much time it takes for the sand to flow
 down once completely. Make a paper scale from this and paste on the glass
 funnels along straight side.

         It is a cylinder made of glass or transparent plastic
with a scale divided in cubic centimetres (cm3 or cc) or                       wrong
millilitres (mL) marked on it. It is used to find the volume
of liquids and non-dissolvable solids.                                         correct
         The level of liquids in the cylinder is marked to find                wrong

cylinder must be placed on a horizontal surface and the
eye shall be kept in level with meniscus of water surface
as shown in Fig. 1.12. The meniscus is the top level of the
liquid surface. Water in the cylinder curves downward               Fig. 1.12

measurement should indicate the estimated error in the measured values.
Usually, there are three types of experimental errors affecting the
measurements.
      (i) Human Errors (ii) Systematic Errors    (iii) Random Errors

(i) Human Errors
       They occur due to personal performance. The limitation of the human
perception such as the inability to perfectly estimate the position of the pointer
on a scale. Personal errors can also arise due to faulty procedure to read the scale.
The correct measurement needs to line up your eye right in front of the level. In
timing experiments, the reaction time of an individual to start or stop clock also
affects the measured value. Human error can be reduced by ensuring proper
training, techniques and procedure to handle the instruments and avoiding
environmental distraction or disturbance for proper focusing. The best way is to
use automated or digital instruments to reduce the impact of human errors.
(ii) Systematic Errors
       They refer to an effect that influences all measurements of particular
measurements equally. It produces a consistence difference in reading. It occurs
due to some definite rule. It may occur due to zero error of instrument, poor
calibration of instrument or incorrect marking. The effect of this kind of error can
be reduced by comparing the instrument with another which is known to be
more accurate. Thus, a correction factor can be applied.

1.10 Uncertainity in a Measurement
        There is no such thing as a perfect measurement. Whenever a physical
quantity is measured except counting, there is inevitably some uncertainty about
its determined value due to some instrument.                Uncertainty in Digital
This uncertainty may be due to use of a number                   Instruments
of reasons. One reason is the type of instrument          Some modern measuring
being used. We know that every measuring instruments have a digital scale.
instrument is calibrated to a certain smallest         We usually estimate one digit
division and this fact puts a limit to the degree       beyond what is certain. With
of accuracy which can be achieved while                digital scale, this is reflected in
measuring with it. Suppose that we want to               fluctuation of the last digit.
measure the length of a straight line with the
help of a metre rule calibrated in millimetres. Let the end point of the line lies
between 10.3 cm and 10.4 cm marks. By convention, if the end of the line does
not touch or cross the midpoint of the smallest division, the reading is confined
to the previous division. In case the end of the line seems to be touching or have
crossed the midpoint, the reading is extended to the next division. Thus, in this
example, the maximum uncertainty is ± 0.05 cm. It is, infact, equivalent to an
uncertainty of 0.1 cm equal to the least count of the instrument divided into two
parts, half above and half below the recorded reading.
        The uncertainty in small length such as diameter of a wire and short
interval of time can be reduced further by taking multiple readings and then
finding average value. For example, the average time of one oscillation of a
simple pendulum is usually found by measuring the time for thirty oscillations.
        The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured quantity can be
indicated conveniently by using significant figures.
1.11 Significant Figures
       We can count the number of candies in a jar and know it exactly by
counting but we cannot measure the height of the jar exactly. All measurements
include uncertainties depending upon the refinement of the instrument which is
used for measurement.
       It is important to reflect the degree of uncertainty in a measurement by
recording the observation in significant figures.
  The significant figures or digits are the digits of a
        measurement which are reliably known.
       Figure 1.14 shows a rod whose length is
measured with a ruler. The measurement shows the
length in between 4.6 cm and 4.7 cm. Since the length            Fig. 1.14

of the rod is slightly more than 4.6 cm but less than 4.7 cm, so the first student
estimates it to be 4.6 cm whereas the second student takes it as 4.7 cm. The first
student thinks that the edge is nearer to 6 mm mark whereas the
                                           20
second student considers the edge of the rod nearer to 7 mm mark. It is difficult
to decide what is the true length.                   Quick Quiz

been determined by estimation only
and has a probability of error. Therefore, it is known as a doubtful digit. In any
measurement, the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit are
known-as significant figures.
        The following points are to be kept in mind while determining the number
of significant figures in any data. All digits from 1 to 9 are significant. However,
zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules apply:
(a) A zero between two digits is considered significant. For example in 5.06m, the
    number of significant figures is 3.
(b) Zeros on the left side of the measured value are not significant. For example,
    in 0.0034 m, the number of significant figures is 2.
(c) Zeros on the right side of a decimal are considered significant. For example, in
    2.40 mm the significant digits are 3.
(d) If numbers are recorded in scientific notation, then all the digits before the
    exponent are significant. For example, in 3.50 × 104m, the significant figures
    are 3.
                                         Quick Quiz
          How many significant figures are there in each of the following?
             (a) 1.25 × 102 m      (b) 12.5 cm       (c) 0.125 m       (d) 0.000125 km

1.12 Precision and Accuracy
       A physical measurements should be precise as well as accurate. These are
two separate concepts and need clear distinction. Generally, precision of a
measurement refers to how close together a group of measurements actually are
to each other. Accuracy of a measurement refers how close the measured value is
to some accepted or true value.
   (a)                              (b)                                 (c)




  Precise not accurate              Accurate not precise                Accurate and precise
                                         Fig. 1.15
       A classic illustration is helpful to distinguish the two concepts. Consider a
target or bullseye hit by arrows in Fig. 1.15. To be precise, arrows must hit near
each other (Fig.1.15-a) and to be accurate, arrows must hit near the bullseye
                                             21
(Fig. 1.15-b). Consistently hitting near the centre of bullseye indicates both
precision and accuracy (Fig. 1.15-c). When these concepts are applied to
measurements, the precision is determined by the instrument being used for
measurement. The smaller the least count, the more precise is the measurement.
A measurement is accurate if it correctly reflects the size of the object being
measured. Accuracy depends on fractional uncertainty in the measurement.
Infact, it is relative measurement which is important. The smaller the size of
physical quantity, the more precise instrument is needed to be used. The
accuracy of measurement is reflected by the number of significant figures, the
larger is the number of significant figures, the higher is the accuracy.

  Type of clock/watch Use and accuracy
  Atomic clock              Measures very short time intervals of about 10-10 seconds.
  Digital stopwatch         Measures short time intervals (in minutes and seconds)
                            to an accuracy to ±0.01 s.
  Analogue stopwatch        Measures short time intervals (in minutes and seconds)
                            to an accuracy to ±0.1 s.
  Ticker-tape timer         Measures short time intervals of 0.02 s.
  Watch/Clock               Measures longer time intervals in hours, minutes and
                            seconds.

  Radioactive decay clock   Measures (in years) the age of remains from thousands
                            of years ago.
1.13 Rounding off the digits
        When rounding off numbers to a certain number of significant figures, do
so to the nearest value. If the last digit is more than 5, the retained digit is
increased by one and if it is less than 5, it is retained as such.
For example:
        (i) Round to 2 significant figures: 2.512 × 10³ m.
                                                               Answer: 2.5 × 10³ m
        (ii) Round to 3 significant figures: 3.4567 × 10⁴ kg.
                                                               Answer: 3.46 × 10⁴ kg
        For the integer 5, there is an arbitrary rule:
If the number before the 5 is odd, one is added to the last digit retained.
If the number before the 5 is even, it remains the same:


                                         22
For example:                                                          Do You Know?
        (i) Round to 2 significant figures: 4.45 × 102 m.
        (ii) Round to 2 significant figures: 4.55 × 102 m.
                                   Answer: 4.4 × 102 m
                                   Answer: 4.6 × 10 m
                                                       2


        Sometimes, logic is applied to decide the fate
of a digit. If we round to 2 significant figures
                                                                           An Electronic timer
4.452 × 102 m, the answer should be 4.5 × 102 m since                      can measure time
4.452 × 102 m is more closer to 4.5 × 102 m than                          intervals as short as
                                                                           one-ten thousands
4.4 × 102 m.                                                            (1/10,000) of a second.

       Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects
and the forces that change it.
Generally, mechanics is divided into two branches:
       1. Kinematics                       2. Dynamics
       Kinematics is the study of motion of objects without referring to forces.
On the other hand, dynamics deals with forces and their effect on the motion of
objects.
       In our everyday life, we observe many objects in motion. For example,
cars, buses, bicycles, motorcycles moving on the roads, aeroplanes flying
through air, water flowing in canals or some object falling from the table to the
ground.
The motion of these objects can be studied with or without considering the force
which causes motion in them or changes it.

2.1 Scalars and Vectors
       Before we study kinematics in detail, we should know about the nature of
various physical quantities. Some quantities are called scalars and the others
vectors.

                  A scalar is that physical quantity which can be
                  described completely by its magnitude only.

       Magnitude includes a number and an appropriate unit. When we ask a
shopkeeper to give us 5 kilograms of sugar, he can fully understand how much
quantity we want. It is the magnitude of mass of sugar. Mass is a scalar quantity.
Some other examples of scalar quantities are distance, length, time, speed,
energy and temperature. Scalar quantities can be added up like numbers.
       For example, 5 metres + 3 metres = 8 metres.
On the other hand,

            A vector is that physical quantity which needs
            magnitude as well as direction to describe it completely.

       The examples of vector quantities are displacement, velocity,
acceleration, weight, force, etc. The velocity of a car moving at 90 kilometre per
hour (25 m s−1) towards north can be represented by a vector. Velocity is a vector
quantity because it has magnitude 25 m s−1 and direction (towards north).
Vectors cannot be added like scalars. There are specific methods to add up
vectors. These methods take their directions also into consideration.
                                        29
Representation of vectors
        In the text book, symbol used for a vector is a bold face letter such as A, v,
F and etc. Since we cannot write in bold face script on paper, so a vector is
                                                      → → →→
written as the letter with a small arrow over it, i.e. A, v, F, d. The magnitude of a
vector is given by italic letter without arrow head. A vector can be represented
graphically by drawing a straight line with an arrow head at one end. The length
of line represents the magnitude of the vector quantity according to a suitable
scale while the direction of arrow indicates the direction of the vector.
                                                                                    v
To represent the direction, two mutually                                N
perpendicular lines are required. We can draw one
line to represent east-west direction and the other
                                                                              θ
line to represent north-south direction as shown in W                                  E
Fig.2.1(a). The direction of a vector can be given                    O

with respect to these lines. Mostly, we use any two
lines which are perpendicular to each other.                            S
Horizontal line (x x ) is called x-axis and vertical line A vector v making an angle θ
( y y ) is called y-axis (Fig. 2.1-b). The point where       towards north from east
these axes meet is known as origin. The origin is                    Fig 2.1 (a)
                                                                        y
usually denoted by O. These axes are also called                                   F

        A vector is drawn starting from the origin of
                                                                                   30

direction is usually given by an angle θ (theta) with
x-axis. The angle with x-axis is always measured from
                                                                               y
the right side of x-axis in the anti-clockwise direction.

Resultant Vector
       We can add two or more vectors to get a single vector. This is called as
resultant vector. It has the same effect as the combined effect of all the vectors to
be added. We have to determine both magnitude and direction of the resultant
vector, therefore, it is quite different from that of scalar addition. One method of
addition of vectors is the graphical method.

Addition of Vectors by Graphical Method
                                                                        y
       Let us add two vectors v1 and v2 having
magnitudes of 300 N and 400 N acting at angles
of 30o and 60o with x-axis. By selecting a suitable
                                                                                60O
scale 100 N = 1cm, we can draw the vectors as
                                                                                      30
                                                                                           O

       To add these vectors, we apply a rule
called head-to-tail rule, which states that:


                                                                        y       Fig. 2.4 (a)


           To add a number of vectors, redraw their representative lines
           such that the head of one line coincides with the tail of the other.
           The resultant vector is given by a single vector which is directed
           from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.

magnitude of the resultant vector v is 680 N and

       When we look around us, we see many things like buildings, trees, electric
poles, etc. which do not change their positions. We say that they are in a state of
rest.




                                        Fig. 2.5 (a)
                If a body does not change its position with
                respect to its surroundings, it is said to be at rest.
        Suppose a motorcyclist is standing on the road (Fig. 2.5-a). An observer
sees that he is not changing his position with respect to his surroundings i.e., a
nearby building, tree or a pole. He will say that the motorcyclist is at rest.
        Now let us see what does motion mean? When the motorcyclist is driving
(Fig. 2.5-b), the observer will notice that he is continuously changing his position
with respect to the surroundings. Then the observer will say that the motorcyclist
is in motion.
If a body continuously changes its position with
respect to its surroundings, it is said to be in
motion.
The state of rest or motion of a body is always
relative. For example, a person standing in the
                                                               Fig. 2.5 (b)
compartment of a moving train is at rest with
respect to the other passengers in the compartment but he is in motion with
respect to an observer standing on the platform of a railway station.

2.3 Types of Motion
       We observe different types of motion in our daily life. A train moves almost
along a straight line, the blades of a fan rotate about an axis, a swing vibrates
about its mean position. Generally, there are three types of motion of bodies.
1. Translatory motion        2. Rotatory motion          3. Vibratory motion
1. Translatory Motion
If the motion of a body is such that every
particle of the body moves uniformly in
the same direction, it is called tanslatory
motion. For example, the motion of a
train or a car is tanslatory motion (Fig.2.6).
Translatory motion can be of three types: Fig. 2.6 The motion of a train is translatory motion
(i.) Linear Motion
      If the body moves along a straight line, it is
      called linear motion. A freely falling body is
      the example of linear motion.
(ii.) Random Motion                                   (a) Irregular path      (b) The motion of bee
      If the body moves along an irregular path             Fig. 2.7            is random motion
      (Fig. 2.7), the motion is called random motion.
(iii.)Circular Motion
      The motion of a body along a circle is called circular
      motion. If a ball tied to one end of a string is whirled, it
      moves along a circle. A Ferris wheel is also an example of
                                                                               Circular Motion
      circular motion (Fig.2.8).                                                     Fig. 2.8
2. Rotatory Motion
If each point of a body moves around a fixed point (axis),
the motion of this body is called rotatory motion. For
example, the motion of an electric fan and the drum of a
                                                                             Rotatory motion of a fan
washing machine dryer is rotatory motion (Fig.2.9). The                              Fig. 2.9
motion of a top is also rotatory motion.

3. Vibratory Motion
When a body repeats its to and fro motion about a fixed
position, the motion is called vibratory motion. The motion
of a swing in a children park is vibratory motion (Fig. 2.10).
                                                                 Fig. 2.10    Vibratory motion

2.4 Distance and Displacement
       We know that motion is the action of an object going from one place to
another or change of position. The length between the original and final
positions may be measured in two ways as either distance or displacement.
              The distance is the length of actual path of the motion.

        Let a person be travelling from Lahore to Multan in a car. On reaching
Multan, he reads the speedometer and notices that he has travelled a distance of
320 km. It is the distance travelled by that person. Obviously, it is not the shortest
distance from Lahore to Multan, as the car took many turns in the way. He did not
travel along a straight line.

    The displacement of an object is a vector quantity whose magnitude is
    the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of the motion
    and its direction is from the initial position to the final position.
We can also call this as the change in position.                                         B

Note that displacement is a vector quantity                                d
whereas distance is a scalar quantity. Following
example will explain the difference between
distance and displacement.                                      A
                                                                       Fig. 2.11
Suppose a car travels from a position A to B. The curved line is the actual path
followed by the car (Fig. 2.11). The total distance covered by the car will be equal
to the length of the curved line AB. The displacement d is the straight line AB
directed from A to B as indicated by the arrow head. The SI unit for the
displacement is the same as that of distance.
2.5 Speed and Velocity                                                    Do You Know?

    Brain Teaser!           We are often interested to
                     know how fast a body is moving. For
                     this purpose, we have to find the
                     distance covered in unit time which
                     is known as speed. If a body covers a
                     distance S in time t, its speed v will be

                                                34
The speed is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of speed is m s-¹ or km h-¹.
It is obvious that speed of a vehicle does not remain constant throughout the
journey. If the reading of the speedometer of the vehicle is observed, it is always
changing. The speed of a vehicle that is shown by its speedometer at any instant
is called instantaneous speed. Practically we make use of the average speed. It
is defined as:
                             Total distance covered                       S
         Average speed =                                   or       vav =

putting the values     t = 300 m / 60 m s–1 = 5 s

Velocity
      The speed of an object does not tell anything about the direction of
motion. To take into account the direction, the vector concept is needed. For this,
we have to find the displacement d between the initial and final positions.

           The net displacement of a body in unit time is called velocity.
If a body moves from point A to B along a curved path as shown in Fig.2.11, the
displacement d is the straight line AB, then
 Average velocity = Displacement               or vav =
                                                          d ............ (2.2)
                          Time                             t
Velocity is a vector quantity. The Equation (2.2) shows that the direction of
velocity v is the same as that of displacement d. The SI unit of velocity is also m s–1
or km h–1. Consider the example of a car moving towards north at the rate of
70 km h–1.To differentiate between speed and velocity, we shall say that the speed

of car is 70 km h–1 which is a scalar quantity. The           For Your Interest!
velocity of the car is a vector quantity whose
magnitude is 70 km h–1 and is directed towards north.
Uniform and Non-uniform Velocity
The velocity is said to be uniform if the speed and               Time-lapse photo of
direction of a moving body does not change. If the                motorway traffic, the

with uniform velocity is the downward motion of a
paratrooper. When a paratrooper jumps from an aeroplane, he falls freely for a
few moments. Then the parachute opens. At this stage the force of gravity acting
downwards on the paratrooper is balanced by the resistance of air on the
parachute that acts upward. Consequently, the paratrooper moves down with
uniform velocity.
2.6 Acceleration
Whenever the velocity of an object is increasing, we
say that the object is accelerating. For example, when
a car overtakes another one, it accelerates to a greater
velocity (Fig.2.12). In contrary to that the velocity
decreases when brakes are applied to slow down a
                                                                   While overtaking, a car

occurs.                                                                   Fig. 2.12

         Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity.
The change in velocity can occur in magnitude or direction or both of them. The
acceleration is positive if the velocity is increasing and it is negative if the velocity
is decreasing. Negative acceleration is also called deceleration or retardation.
Acceleration is a vector quantity like velocity, but the direction of acceleration is
that of change of velocity. If a body is moving with an initial velocity vi and after
some time t its velocity changes to vf , the change in velocity is ∆v = vf - vi that
occurs in time t. In this case, rate of change of velocity i.e., acceleration will be
average acceleration.

 the acceleration is said to be uniform.
If anyone of the magnitude or direction or both of them changes it is called
variable or non-uniform acceleration. In this class, we will solve problems only for
the motion of the bodies having uniform acceleration and not the variable
acceleration.

axes as shown in Fig 2.13. The point where the
two axes intersect each other is known as origin o. Positive values along x-axis are
taken to the right side of the origin and negative values are taken to the left side.
Similarly, positive values along y-axis are taken above the origin whereas
negative values are taken below the origin. Normally, the independent quantity
is taken along x-axis and dependent variable quantity along y-axis. For example,
in distance-time graph, t is independent and S is dependent variable. Therefore,
t should be along x-axis and S along y-axis.
       To represent a physical quantity along any axis, a suitable scale is chosen
by considering the minimum and maximum values of the quantity.

Distance-Time Graph
Distance-time graph shows the relation between distance S and time t taken by a
moving body.
Let a car be moving in a straight line on a motorway. Suppose that we measure its
distance from starting point after every one minute, and record it in the table

     speed. Therefore, a straight line graph                   Fig. 2.14
     between time and distance represents motion with uniform speed.
Now consider another journey of the car as recorded in the table given below:

    S (km)
Table shows that speed goes on increasing in equal intervals of time. This is very
obvious from the graph as shown in Fig. 2.15. The graph line is curved upward.
This is the case when the body (car) is moving with certain acceleration.

The graph line is curved downwards. This shows that distance travelled in the
same interval of time goes on decreasing, so speed is decreasing. This is the case
of motion with deceleration or negative acceleration as shown in Fig.2.16.

Graph line is horizontal in this case (Fig 2.17). It shows that the distance covered

2.8 Gradient of a Distance-Time Graph
The gradient is the measure of slope         y
of a line.
Consider the distance-time graph of                                           Q

The slope or gradient of the graph is the measure of tangent θ of the triangle RPQ:

                S₂ – S₁         S
   Slope =                  =
                 t₂ – t₁        t
   From Eq. (2.1),    S     = v a , the average speed during the time interval t.
                      t
   Figure 2.17 shows that       S       = tan θ = slope of graph line, therefore,
                                t
        Gradient of the distance-Time graph is equal to the average
        speed of the body.

2.9 Speed-Time Graph
       Suppose we can note the speed of the same car after every one second
and record it in the table given below, we can draw the graph between speed v
versus time t. This is called speed-time graph.
                                          Table

Take t along x-axis and v along y-axis. Scale can be selected as 1 s = 1 cm (x-axis)
and speed 10 m s −1 = 1 cm along y-axis.
Shape of the graph is shown in Fig. 2.19· It is a straight line rising upward. This
shows that speed increases by the same amount after every one second. This is a
motion with uniform acceleration. It is also evident from the table.

Now consider another case. The observations are recorded in the table given
below:

                                                                   Table

In this case, graph line is horizontal (Fig. 2.20) parallel to time x- axis. It shows that
speed does not change with change in time. This is a motion with constant
speed.

2.10 Gradient of a Speed-Time Graph
Now consider the speed-time graph (Fig. 2.21). The speeds at times t₁ and t₂ are
v₁ and v₂ respectively. The change in speed in a time interval (t₂ - t₁) is (v₂ -v₁).
Therefore,                                    Y

or Slope =

                                                                                                              (v₁ - v₁)

    But      = a, the average acceleration.                     v₁                                                R
           t                                                                        (t₂ - t₁)

                                                                O         t₁               t (s)           t₂             X
                                                                                   Fig. 2.21
Hence              Gradient of the speed-Time graph is equal
                   to the average acceleration of the body.
This shows that when a car moves with constant acceleration, the velocity-time
graph is a straight line which rises through same height for equal intervals of time.
        Graph of Fig. 2.19 is redrawn in Fig. 2.22 to find its slope. The speed v₁ at
time t₁ is the same as speed v₂ at time t₂, hence, the change in speed is also zero.
                                 (v₂ – v₁)                      Y
v₂ – v₁ = 0. Thus, the slope =               =0             3

                                 (t₂ – ₁)
      When the speed of the object is                           20

constant, the speed-time graph is a                             10
horizontal straight line parallel to time                                 v₁                         v₂

                                                                     t₁        t (s)            t₂
        This shows that the acceleration                                                                  Fig. 2.22
of this motion is zero. It is the motion without the change in speed.
2.11 Area Under Speed-Time Graph
       The distance moved by an object can also be determined by using its
speed-time graph. For example, figure 2.23 shows that the object is moving
with constant speed v. For a time-interval t, the distance covered by the object
as given by Eq. 2.1 is v × t.
                                             43
This distance can also be found by               Y
calculating the area under the speed-time            v
graph. The area under the graph for time
                                                 v                                            v

                                                                                t
and v. This area is shown shaded in Fig.2.23

numerically equal to the distance covered                v                                        A
by the object in time t.
Now consider another example shown in
Fig. 2.24. Here, the speed of the object         v
increases uniformly from 0 to v in time t.
                                                                                                t
The average speed is given by                        O       Fig. 2.24      t                  B X

              vav = 0 2+ v = 2 1 v

Distance covered = average speed × time = 1/2 v × t.                        Mini Exercise
If we calculate the area under speed-time graph, it
is equal to the area of the right-angled triangle
shown shaded in Fig. 2.24. The base of the triangle
                                                                 distance                  cyclist B
is equal to t and the perpendicular is equal to v.
Area of a triangle = 1/2 (perpendicular × base)
                   = 1/2 (v × t)

We see that this area is numerically equal to the                                   time
distance covered by the object during the time
                                            The distance-time graph shows

While applying these equations, the following assumptions are made:
(i.)   Motion is always considered along a straight line
(ii.)  Only the magnitudes of vector quantities are used.
(iii.) Acceleration is assumed to be uniform.
(iv.) The direction of initial velocity is taken as positive. Other quantities which
       are in the direction of initial velocity are taken as positive. The quantities in
       the direction opposite to the initial velocity are taken as negative.
2.13 Free Fall Acceleration
When a body is falling freely under the action of gravity of the Earth, the
acceleration acting on it is the gravitational acceleration and is denoted by g. The
direction of gravitational acceleration is always downwards. Its value is 9.8 m s ²,
                                                                                  −


but for convenience we shall use the value of g as 10 m s−².
      For Your Information!            Since the freely falling bodies move vertically
                                       downwards in a straight line with uniform
                                       acceleration g, so the three equations of
                                       motion can be applied to the motion of such
                                       bodies. While applying equations of motion,
                                       the acceleration a is replaced by g. Thus,
                                       equations of motion for freely falling bodies
                                       can be written as:
                                          v f = v + gt        - ---------------(1)

equations, the following points should be kept in mind:
(i.)    If a body is released from some height to fall
        freely, its initial velocity vi will be taken as zero.
(ii.)   The gravitational acceleration g will be taken as
        positive in the downward direction. All other
        quantities will also be taken as positive in the
        downward direction. The quantities in the
        direction opposite to the acceleration will be
        taken as negative.
                                                               Acceleration of free fall g is
(iii.) If a body is thrown vertically upward, the value 10 m s −² for all objects.
        of g will be negative and the final velocity will be
        zero at the highest point.

 Example 2.5
An iron bob is dropped from the top of a tower. It reaches the ground in 4
seconds. Find: (a) the height of the tower (b) the velocity of the ball as it strikes
the ground.
   Solution
   For freely falling body:
   Initial velocity      =    vi        = 0
   Acceleration          =    g         = 10 m s ²

   Final velocity        =    vf = ?
(a) According to second equation of motion,
                          1

 Putting the values, h = 0 x 4 s +     × 10 m s−² × (4)² s²
                                    2
                        h = 80 m
 (b) From the first equation of motion, we have
                  v f = v + gt

An arrow is thrown vertically upward with the help of a bow. The velocity of the
arrow when it leaves the bow is 30 m s−¹. Determine time to reach the highest
point? Also, find the maximum height attained by the arrow.
  Solution
Here, acceleration will be taken as negative, for the arrow is thrown vertically
upward.
   Initial velocity      = v i = 30 m s−¹
   Final velocity        = vf = 0
   Acceleration          = g = -10 m s ²

                               0 – 30 m s−¹
   Putting the values t =                   = 3s
                                 –10 m s−²

Now from the third equation of motion:
                2gS = vf² – vⁱ²
                           v ² – vⁱ²
   or                  S = f

   Putting the values h = 2 × 10 m s−² = 45 m

Relativity
        In 1905, famous scientist Albert Einstein proposed his revolutionary
theory of special relativity which modified many of the basic concepts of physics.
According to this theory, speed of light is a universal constant. Its value is
approximately 3 ×108 m s−1. Speed of light remains the same for all motions. Any
object with mass cannot achieve speeds equal to or greater than that of light.
This is known as universal speed limit.

       In kinematics, we studied the motion of objects. If the position, velocity
and acceleration were known at any time, then the position and velocity of the
moving body at another time could be completely described. But one of the
things left out of this discussion was the cause of acceleration produced in the
body. If a stone is dropped from a height, it is accelerated downward. It is
because the Earth exerts a force of gravity on the stone that pulls it down. When
we drive a car or motorcycle, the engine exerts a force which produces
acceleration. We will observe that whenever there is acceleration, there is always
a force present to cause that acceleration. Dynamics is concerned with the forces
that produce change in the motions of bodies.
3.1 Concept of Force
        A common concept of a force is a push or a
pull that starts, stops or changes the magnitude and
direction of velocity of a body. We come across many
forces in our daily life. Some of them we apply on
other bodies and some are acting on us. For
example, when we open a door, we push or pull it by
applying force. When we are sitting in a car, we push
against the seat as the car turns round a corner.
        Force transfers energy to an object. Take the
example of a man who moves a wheelbarrow with its                     Fig. 3.1

load. The man first applies force to lift it and then applies force to push it (Fig.3.1).
He applies a different amount of force on each handle when turning the
wheelbarrow around the corner in order to keep it from tipping over. The
examples of forces acting on us are the force of gravity acting downward, the
force of friction which helps us to walk on the ground and many others.
Types of Forces
There are two major types of forces:
       1. Contact Forces                        2. Non-contact Forces
 1. Contact Forces
        A contact force is a force that is exerted by one object on the other at the
point of contact. Applied forces (push a pull and twist) are contact forces. Some
other examples of contact forces are the following:
(i) Friction
        It is the force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes in
contact with the surface of another.
                                           53
(ii) Drag
           The drag force is the resistant force caused by the motion of a body
through a fluid. It acts opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with
respect to surrounding fluid.
(iii) Thrust
           It is an upward force exerted by a liquid on an object immersed in it. When
we try to immerse an object in water, we feel an upward force exerted on the
object. This force increases as we push the object deeper into the water. A ship
can float in the sea due to this force which balances the weight of the ship.
(iv) Normal Force
            It is the force of reaction exerted by the surface on an object lying on it.
This force acts outward and perpendicular to the surface. It is also called the
support force upon the object.
(v) Air Resistance
       It is the resistance (opposition) offered by air when an object falls through it.
(vi) Tension Force
           It is the force experienced by a rope when a person or load pulls it.
(vii) Elastic Force
           It is a force that brings certain materials back to their original shape after
being deformed. Examples are rubber bands, springs, trampoline, etc.
   2. Non-contact Forces
           A non-contact force is defined as the force between two objects which are
not in physical contact. The non-contact forces can work from a distance. That is
why, these are sometimes called as action-at-a-distance. There is always a field
linked with a non-contact force. Due to this property, non-contact forces are also
called field forces. A few examples of non-contact forces are described below:
(i) Gravitational Force
        An apple falling down from a tree is one of the best examples of
gravitational force (Fig. 3.2). When we throw an object upward, it is the
gravitational force of the Earth that brings it back to the
Earth. In fact, the gravitational force is an attractive force
that exists among all bodies which have mass. It is a
long-range force given by Newton's law of gravitation:
                F = G m1 m 2 where m1 and m2 are two
                        r2
masses distant r apart and G is constant of gravitation. Its value
is 6.67 × 10–11 N m2 kg–2. The Sun's gravitational force keeps the
Earth and all other planets of our solar system in fixed orbits.   Fig. 3.2
Similarly, the gravitational force of the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. It also
keeps the atmosphere and oceans fixed to the surface of the Earth. Even an
object resting on a surface exerts a downward force called its weight due to
attractive force of the Earth also known as gravity.
                                           54
(ii) Electrostatic Force
        An electrostatic force acts between two charged
objects. The opposite charges attract each other and
similar charges repel each other as shown in Fig. 3.3. Force                 Force
Like gravitational force, electrostatic force is also a
long-range force.
(iii) Magnetic Force
       It is a force which a magnet exerts on other
                                                                  Fig. 3.3
magnets and magnetic materials like iron, nickel and
cobalt. You might have observed that iron pins
attracted in the presence of a magnet without any
physical contact (Fig. 3.4). Magnetic force between the
poles of two magnets can be either attractive or
repulsive. This can be observed very easily by bringing
different poles of two magnets close to each other. Like
poles repel and unlike poles attract each other.                  Fig. 3.4
(iv) Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces
        These are also non-contact forces acting between the subatomic
particles. We will study these forces in the next section.
3.2 Fundamental Forces
There are four fundamental forces in nature. These are:
  1. Gravitational force           2.     Electromagnetic force
  3. Strong nuclear force          4.     Weak nuclear force
Every force comes under any of these forces.
Gravitational Force
       The gravitational force has been discussed in the previous section. We
often talk about this force. It is the weakest one among all four forces. Being a
long range force, it extends to infinite distance although it becomes weaker and
weaker.
Electromagnetic Force
       It is the force that causes the interaction
between electrically charged particles. Electrostatic
and magnetic forces come under this category. These
are long-range forces. The areas in which these forces
act are called electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic      Fig. 3.5
                                                       A moving magnet
forces are stronger than gravitational and weak produces electric current
                                       55
nuclear forces. This force causes all chemical reactions. It binds together atoms,
molecules and crystals etc. At macroscopic level, it is a possible cause of friction
between different surfaces in relative motion.

Strong Nuclear Forces

It holds the atomic nuclei together by binding the
protons and neutrons in the nucleus over coming
repulsive electromagnetic force between positively
charged protons. It is also a short-range force with
the order of 10 ¹⁴m. If the distance between
                  −


nucleons increases beyond this range, this force
ceases to act.                                                      Fig. 3.6
                                                            The binding force of
                                                            protons and neutrons
Weak Nuclear Force                                             in the nucleus

       Weak nuclear force is responsible for the
                                                            Electron
disintegration of a nucleus. For example, the
weak nuclear force executes the β-decay (beta Proton                 Neutron

decay) of a neutron, in which a neutron                                     Neutrino
transforms into a proton (Fig.3.7). In the process,
a β-particle (electron) and an uncharged particle
called antineutrino are emitted. In other words,
we can say that due to weak nuclear force
radioactive decay of atoms occurs. However,                Fig. 3.7

weak nuclear force is stronger than the gravitational force but weaker than the
electromagnetic force. It is a short-range force of the order 10-17 m.

Unification of Weak Nuclear and Electromagnetic Forces
       A Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdus Salam along with Sheldon Glashow and
Steven Weinberg were awarded in 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their
contributions to the unification of the weak nuclear force and electromagnetic
force as electroweak force. Although these two forces appear to be different in
everyday phenomena, but the theory models them as two different aspects of
the same force. Its effects are observed for the interactions taking place at very
high energy.

3.3 Forces in a Free- Body Diagram
        External forces acting on an object may
include friction, gravity, normal force, drag, Applied force
tension in a string or a human force due to
pushing or pulling.
        Suppose a book is pushed over the
surface of a table top as shown in Fig.3.8(a).
Then how can we represent the forces acting
on the body using free-body diagram?
        Free-body diagrams are used to show                   Fig. 3.8 (a)
the relative magnitudes and directions of all
the forces acting on an object in a given
situation. In other words, a free-body diagram            Normal force
is a special example of the vector diagrams.
        Usually, the object is represented by a    Friction            Applied force
box and the force arrows are drawn outward
from the centre of the box in the directions of
forces as shown in Fig.3.8(b). The length of a

force arrow (line) reflects the magnitude of the
force and the arrow head indicates the                      Fig. 3.8 (b)
direction in which the force acts. Each force is
labelled to indicate the exact type of force.

 3.4 Newton’s Laws of Motion
                                                               Do You Know?
Newton’s First Law of Motion
                                                          Sir Isaac Newton was born
        It is our common observation that a force         in Lincolnshire on January
is required to move or to stop a body. A book              4, 1643. The name of his
placed on a table remains there unless a force is         famous book is “Principia
applied to move it (Fig.3.9). A ball rolling on floor            Mathematica”.

should continue to move with the same velocity
in the absence of an applied force. But practically,
we see that it is not true. The ball stops after
covering some distance. In fact, an opposing
force (friction) causes the ball to stop. Newton
expressed such observations in his first law of
motion which states that:
                                         57                       Fig. 3.9
            A body continues its state of rest or of uniform motion in a
            straight line unless acted upon by some external force.

When a fast-moving bus stops suddenly, the passengers tend to bend forward. It
is because they want to continue their motion. On the other hand, when the bus
starts moving quickly from rest, the passengers are pushed back against the seat.
This time, the tendency of passengers is to retain their state of rest.
        According to first law of motion, a bus moving on the road should
continue its motion without any force exerted by the engine. But practically, we
see that if the engine stops working, the bus comes to rest after covering some
distance. It is because of the friction between the tyres of the bus and the road. All
the bodies moving on the Earth are stopped by the force of friction. If you were in
outer space and throw an object away where no force is acted upon it, the object
would continue to move forever with constant velocity.
        The first law of motion also provides us another definition of force which is
stated as follows:

              Force is an agency which changes or tends to change
                the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body.

       In simple words, we can say that force causes acceleration.

Inertia                                                       A Demonstration of
                                                              Property of Inertia
 A net force is required to change the velocity of
objects. For instance, a net force may cause a
bicycle to pick up speed quickly. But when the same
force is applied to a truck, any change in the motion
may not be observed. We say that the truck has
more inertia than a bicycle. The mass of an object is
a measure of its inertia. The greater the mass of an
object, the greater is its inertia.

The property of a body to maintain its state of rest or
of uniform motion in a straight line is called inertia.
         As a result of the role of inertia in Newton's
first law, this law is sometimes called as law of When the table cloth is pulled
inertia.                                                abruptly, the objects remain in
                                                           their original position on the
                                                                       table.
                                           58
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
       Newton's first law indicates that if no net force acts on an object, then the
velocity of the object remains unchanged. The second law deals with the
acceleration produced in a body when a net force acts upon it. Newton's second
law can be stated as:

  If a net external force acts upon a body, it accelerates the body in the
  direction of force. The magnitude of acceleration is directly proportional to
  the magnitude of force and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body.

       If a net force of magnitude F acts on a body of mass m and produces an
acceleration of magnitude a, then the second law can be written mathematically
as:
                          and       a ∝ F
                                          1

According to SI units, if m = 1 kg, a = 1 m s-2, F = 1 N, then the value of the
constant will be 1. Therefore, the above equation can be written as:

                          a= 1× F
                                     m

       First law of motion provides the definition of force, i.e., a force produces
an acceleration in a body. By the second law of motion (F = ma), we can calculate
mathematically, the amount of force required to produce a certain amount of
acceleration in a body of known mass. The SI unit of force is newton (N).

                  One newton is the force which produces an
                  acceleration of 1 m s ² in a body of mass 1 kg.

 Effect of Force on Velocity
       Newton’s second law also tells that a force can change the velocity of a
body by producing acceleration or deceleration in it. As velocity is a vector
quantity, so the change may be in its magnitude, direction or in both of them.

Newton’s Third Law of Motion
        Whenever there is an interaction between two
bodies A and B, such that the body A exerts a force on
                                                             A
body B, the force is known as action of A on B. In
response to this action, the body B exerts a force on
the body A. This force is known as reaction of B on A.
For example, when we press a spring, the force exerted        B
by our hand on the spring is action. Our hand also
experiences a force exerted by the spring. This is the
force of reaction (Fig.3.10). Newton expressed these
action and reaction forces in his third law of motion. It
is stated as:                                                        Fig. 3.10
         For every action, there is always                    Do You Know?
         an equal and opposite reaction.
                                                                                 R
       Since, action and reaction do not act                  F
on the same body but they act on two
different bodies, so they can never balance
each other. Thus, Newton's third law can also
be expressed as follows:
I f one body exerts a force on a second body,        In space, an astronaut throws a
    the second body also exerts an equal and         wrench, as a reaction he moves in
         opposite force on the first body.           opposite direction.

Forces Act in Pairs
       We have study that forces act in pairs when two objects interact, i.e.,
action and reaction forces. We often notice a force that seems to make
something happen but usually we do not notice the other force involved. Here
are some examples of pairs of forces involved in accordance with Newton's third
law of motion.

       The force acting downward on the block is the weight. The block exerts a

3.5 Limitations of Newton’s Laws of Motion
       We have already explained that Newton's laws of motion can be applied
with very high degree of accuracy to the motion of objects and velocities which
we come across in everyday life.
       The problems arise when we deal with the motion of elementary particles
having velocities close to that of light. For that purpose, relativistic mechanics
developed by Albert Einstein is applicable.
       After all this discussion, we can say that Newton's laws of motion are not
exact for all types of motion, but provide a good approximation, unless an object
is small enough or moving close to the speed of light.

3.6 Mass and Weight
       Commonly, we consider mass and weight as the same quantities but
scientifically, mass and weight are two different quantities. When we say that the
weight of this object is 5 kg, it is not true. In fact, 5 kg is the mass of the object. The
simplest definition of mass is that it is a measure of the quantity of matter in a
body. Scientifically, mass of a body can be defined as:

  The characteristic of a body which determines the magnitude of acceleration
  produced when a certain force acts upon it is known as mass of the body.

       Mass is a scalar quantity. It remains the same everywhere. Practically, mass
is measured by an ordinary balance. The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).
       Weight is a gravitational force acting on the object. It is a vector quantity
directed downward, towards the centre of the Earth.

                The weight of an object is equal to the force with
                which the Earth attracts the body towards its centre.


 Gravitational Field

       The gravitational field is a space around a mass in which another mass
experiences a force due to gravitational attraction. The gravitational field
strength is defined as the gravitational force acting on unit mass. Thus, mass m
on the surface of the Earth exerts a force known as its weight w given by w = m g,
where g is the gravitational field strength. Its value is 10 N kg-1.
       As the value of g varies from place to place and also with altitude,
therefore, the value of weight does not remain the same everywhere.
       It varies from place to place according to variation in g. Though an
object's weight may vary from one place to another, but at any particular
location, its weight is proportional to its mass. Thus, we can conveniently
compare the masses of two objects at a given location by comparing their
weights. The weight cannot be measured by an ordinary balance. A spring
balance can be used to measure the weight. The SI unit of weight is newton (N).

acceleration of 2 m s−². What is the force acting on the block?

Mass of truck         = m       = 3000 kg

                                7500 N
  Putting the values, a =                = 2.5 m s−2

  Now, using first equation of motion,

3.7 Mechanical and Electronic Balances
      Balance scales are commonly used to compare masses of objects or to
weigh objects by balancing them with standard weights.

Mechanical Balances
        A mechanical balance consists of a
rigid horizontal beam that oscillates on a
central knife edge as a fulcrum. It has two
end knife edges equidistant from the centre.
Two pans are hung from bearings on the end
knife edges (Fig.3.16). The material to be
weighed is put in one pan. Standard weights
                                                      Fig. 3.16
are put on the other pan. The deflection of
the balance may be indicated by a pointer
attaches to the beam. The weights on the
pan are adjusted to bring the beam in
equilibrium.
        There is another type of mechanical
balances which are used to weigh heavy
items like flour bags, cement bags, steel
bars, etc. These are called mechanical
platform balances (Fig.3.17). Standard
weights are not required to use this balance.
Its reason is that the fulcrum of the beam of
such a balance is kept very near to its one
end. Therefore, much smaller weights have
to be put at the other end of beam to bring it
to equilibrium. These smaller weights have
already been calibrated to the standard
weights.                                                       Fig. 3.17
Electronic Balances
        No standard weights are required to
use in an electronic balance (Fig.3.18). Only
it has to be connected to a power supply.
There are some models which can operate
by using dry cell batteries. An electronic
balance is more precise than mechanical
balance. When an object is placed on it, its
mass is displayed on its screen. Now-a-days,
                                                   Fig. 3.18
                                        64
electronic balances also display the total price of the material if the rate per kg is
fed to the balance.
Force Meter
        A force meter is a scientific instrument that measures
force. It is also called as a newton meter or a spring balance
(Fig.3.19). Now a days digital force meters are also available.
You have already learnt about mechanical and electronic
balances. They measure mass of the objects in kilograms or its
multiples. On the other hand, force meter measures force
directly in newtons (N).
        An ordinary force meter has a spring inside it. Upper
end of the spring is attached to a handle. A hook is attached to
the lower end the spring that holds the object. A pointer is also
attached to the spring at its upper end. A scale in newtons is
provided along the spring such that the pointer coincides with
zero of the scale when nothing is hung with the hook.
        The object to be weighed is hung
with the hook. The mass of the object                                   Fig. 3.19

causes the spring to compress. The
pointer indicates the weight of the
object. However, some force meters are
also based on the stretching of the
spring when a load is hung. In this case,
                                                                    Do You Know?
the pointer is attached at the lower end
of the spring.
        In some spring balances, the
scale measures the mass which can be
readily converted into newtons by                                        The weight
                                                                          of 100 g
multiplying the mass in kg with the value
                                                                         mass is 1 N.
of g = 10 m s-2.
        A digital force meter measures
directly the weight of the object in

3.8 Friction
       When a cricket ball is hit by the bat, it moves on the ground with a
reasonably large velocity. According to Newton's first law of motion, it should
continue to move with constant velocity. But, practically, we observe that it
eventually stops after covering some distance. Does any force act on the ball in
opposite direction that stops the ball? Yes, it is the force of friction between the
ball and the ground that opposes the motion of the ball.

Dissipative Effect of Friction
         Friction is a dissipative force due to which the energy is wasted in doing
work to overcome against friction. The lost energy appears in the form of heat.
         A very common example of energy dissipation is
the rubbing of hands (Fig.3.21). When we rub our hands,
heat is produced due to friction and our hands become
warm. Similarly, the temperature of machines rises due
to friction between its moving parts that can cause many
problems. The tyres of vehicles also wear out after
becoming too hot due to friction between tyres and
                                                             Fig. 3.21 Rubbing hands
road.
       Shooting of stars seen in the sky at night also happen due to friction of air.
These are actually asteroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere. As they are
moving, air resistance causes generation of heat. Their temperature becomes so
high that they start burning and ultimately disintegrate.
                                        Do You Know?
                On a wet road, the water does not form
       wet layer between the tyre surface and the road
       surface due to the spaces in the tread pattern on
       the tyre. This reduces the chances of skidding of
       vechicles on wet roads.




Sliding Friction
       The friction between two solid surfaces is called sliding friction which can
be divided into two categories.
       1. Static friction         2. Kinetic friction

weights including pan. When the block is sliding, friction still exists. It is known as
kinetic friction.

        When a shuttle re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere, the friction caused by the
         atmosphere raises the surface temperature of the shuttle to over 950°C.

Terminal Velocity
        When an object falls freely, it is accelerated by an amount g = 10 m s−2. But
practically the acceleration may be different. Air resistance plays an important
role in determining how fast an object accelerates when it falls.
        If we drop a cricket ball and a piece of Styrofoam of the same weight from
a certain height, they will hit the ground at the same time only if there were no air
resistance. Both would fall with the same acceleration
g = 10 m s−2. Practically, the ball in air, would drop faster.
The Styrofoam having larger surface would face greater
opposing force of the air and thus moves slowly.
        Experiments have been made in this respect and
it was found that the faster an object falls the more air
resistance will be exerted on it. A speed is finally attained
at which the upward force of air resistance balances the
downward force of gravity. When this happens, the Fig. 3.23
object stops accelerating. It keeps falling at a constant A paratrooper falling with

velocity. This constant velocity achieved by an object is called its terminal
velocity. Even a heavy object like a meteorite does not gain an infinite velocity as
it falls to the Earth.
         This principle applies to paratroopers. Air resistance acting against the
large surface area of a parachute allows for descent at a safer velocity (Fig.3.23).

Rolling Friction
         The static and kinetic friction which we have studied so far is the sliding
friction. There is another type of friction which is called rolling friction. When an
object rolls over a surface, the friction produced is called rolling friction. The idea

Methods to Reduce Friction
The following methods are used to reduce friction:
(i)   The parts which slide against each other are highly polished.
(ii) Since, the friction of liquids is less than that of solid
      surfaces, therefore, oil or grease is applied between
      the moving parts of the machinery.
(iii) As rolling friction is much less than the sliding
      friction, so sliding friction is converted into rolling         Fig. 3.24
      friction by the use of ball bearings (Fig. 3.24) in the machines and wheels
      under the heavy objects.
(iv) Frictional force does not act only among solids, high speed vehicles,
      aeroplanes and ships also face friction
      while moving through air or water. If the
      front of a vehicle is flat, it faces more
      resistance by air or water. Therefore, the
      bodies moving through air or water are
      streamlined to minimize air or water
      friction. In this case, the air passes        Fig. 3.25 Streamline air flow over
      smoothly over the slanting surface of                        a speedy car
      vehicle. This type of flow of air is known as streamline flow. A streamline
      flow over the car is shown in Fig. 3.25. The vehicles designed pointed from
      the front are said to be streamlined.
3.9 Momentum and Impulse
          Suppose that a bicycle rider and a heavy truck are moving with the same
speed, which one can be stopped easily, depends on the quantity of motion of
the moving body. It is our common observation that quantity of motion in a
moving body depends on its mass and velocity. Greater is the mass, the greater
will be the quantity of motion. Similarly, greater is the velocity, the greater will be
quantity of motion. This quantity of motion is called momentum and denoted by
p. It is defined as:
  The momentum of a moving body is the product of its mass and velocity.
                      Therefore,       p = m × v............................. (3.2)
Like velocity momentum is also a vector quantity. The SI unit momentum is
(kg m s–1). It can also be written as (N s).

        When a ball is hit by a bat, the force is exerted on the ball for a very short
interval of time. In such cases, it is very difficult to calculate the exact magnitude
of the force. However, initial velocity vi of the ball and final velocity vf after
collision can be found easily.
        During a time interval ∆ t, the average acceleration a is given by
                                 ∆v  v − vi
                           a =      = f                                    (3.3)
                                 ∆t     ∆

       According to Newton's second law of motion, the value of average force
acting during the interval ∆ t will be:
                                ∆v
               F = ma = m(           )
                                ∆t
    or         F × ∆ t = m(∆v) = m (vf − vi)                  (3.4)
      Equation (3.4) shows that F and ∆ t cannot be exactly known but their
product which is equal to the change of momentum (mvf – mvi) can be
calculated. For such cases, the product F × ∆ t is called as Impulse of the force.

  When a large force F acts on an object for a short interval of time, the impulse
  of the force is defined as the total change in momentum of the object.

Dividing both sides of Eq.3.4 by ∆t, we have
                             m(∆v)
                        F = ...................................... (3.5)
                                 ∆t
where m(∆v) is the change in momentum ∆p. Equation (3.5) gives the value of
force in terms of momentum i.e., force acting on an object is equal to the change
in momentum of the object per unit time.
                            ∆p
                      F =                 . ............ (3.6)
                            ∆t
Equation (3.6) suggests to define Newton’s second law of motion in terms of
momentum i.e.,
                           The rate of change of momentum of a
                           body is equal to the force acting on it.

The direction of change in momentum is that of the force.

                           Packing of Fragile Objects
  Fragile objects such as glassware may break easily due to
  jerks or by the direct impact with hard objects during
  their transportation.
  To protect them soft, packing materials are used for
  these objects. These materials reduce the effect of quick
  change in momentum. Consequently, the force acting on the fragile objects
  is greatly reduced. Special materials like Styrofoam, corrugated cardboard
  sheets, bubble wrap are used for the packing of such objects.

 automobile is a structural
 feature designed to compress
 during an accident to absorb
 deformation energy from the
 impact. Typically, crumple
 zones are located in front and
 behind of the main body of
 the vehicle.
 Crumple zones work by managing crash energy absorbing within the outer
 parts of the vehicle, rather than being directly transmitted to the occupants.
 This is achieved by controlled weakling of outer parts (plastic bumpers, etc.)
 of the vehicle, while strengthening of the passenger cabin.

 Example 3.3
 A bullet of mass 15 g is fired by a gun. If the velocity of the bullet is 150 m s–¹,
what is its momentum?
 Solution
Mass of bullet            = m = 15 g            = 0.015 kg
                                           71
Velocity of bullet    = v     = 150 m s−1
Momentum              = p = ?
Using the formula,    p     =     mv
Putting the value,    p = 0.015 kg × 150 m s−¹
or                    p = 2.25 kg m s ¹
                                      −



 Example 3.4
       A cricket ball of mass 160 g is hit by a bat. The ball leaves the bat with a
velocity of 52 m s–¹. If the ball strikes the bat with a velocity of -28 m s–¹ (opposite
direction) before hitting, find the average force exerted on the ball by the bat.
The ball remains in contact with the bat for 4 × 10–³ s.
 Solution
Mass of ball          m = 160 g        = 0.16 kg
Initial velocity      vi = −28 m s ¹
                                   −


Final velocity        vf = 52 m s−¹
Time of contact       t = 4 ×10−³ s
Average force         F=?
From Eq. (3.6), we have
                         m(vf − vi)
                     F =
                             t
Putting the values, 0.16 kg [52 m s−¹ − (−28 m s−¹)]
                    F=
                                    4 × 10−³ s

3.10 Principle of Conservation of Momentum
                                                           v₁     v₂
The collection of objects is known as a ‘system’. If no
external force acts on any object of the system, it is
known as isolated system. Consider a system of two m₁   m₂

balls of masses m₁ and m₂. Suppose that the balls        F   -F

are moving with velocities v1 and v2 along a straight
                                                         m₁ m₂
line in the same direction. If v1 > v2 , the balls will       v₁        v₂
collide as shown in Fig. 3.26. If their velocities
become v₁ , and v ₂ respectively after collision, then
Total momentum of the system before collision = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂     Fig. 3.26

Total momentum of the system after collision         = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂
The principle of conservation of momentum states that:
                                           72
    If no external force acts on an isolated system, the final total momentum
    of the system is equal to the initial total momentum of the system.
This means, that:
               Total momentum of the                     Total momentum of the
                                               =
               system before collision                    system after collision
                or m₁v₁ + m₂v₂                =           m₁v ₁ + m₂v ₂
       To explain this principle, let us consider the collision of two identical balls
in which the second ball is at rest.
                                                             v₁         v₂ = 0
       When there is collision of two balls, there is
a transfer of momentum from one ball to another.                F    −F

The ball at rest gains momentum and starts
moving whereas the striking ball slows down. If                          v₁ = ₀
                                                                                  v₂ = v₁
the balls are identical, we will observe that there is
a total transfer of momentum. The striking ball                Fig. 3.27

comes to rest and the other ball starts moving with the same speed (Fig.3. 27). It
means that second ball gains momentum equal to that lost by the first one. If the
first ball stops after collision, the second ball moves with the momentum of the
first ball. This suggests that the total momentum of the two balls after collision
remains the same as total momentum before collision.
The principle of conservation                            Seatbelts
of momentum is applicable         When a moving car stops suddenly,
not only to macro-objects         the passengers move forward
but also for micro-objects        toward the windshield. Seatbelts
                                  prevent the passengers from
like atoms and molecules.         moving. Thus, chances of hitting the
                                  passengers against the windshield
                                  or steering wheel are reduced.
 Example 3.5
       A bullet of mass m 1 is fired by a gun of mass m₂. Find the velocity of the
gun in terms of velocity of bullet v₁ just after firing.

 Solution
       Before firing, the velocity of bullet as well as that of gun was zero.
Therefore, total momentum of bullet and gun was also zero. After firing, the
bullet moves forward with velocity v₁ whereas the gun moves with velocity v₂.
                                          73
According     to    law of     conservation    of momentum,
     Total momentum before firing      = Total momentum after firing
Putting the values,              0     = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂
                                 m₂v₂ = − m₁v₁
       or
                                           −m₁v₁
                                    v₂ =
                                            m₂
     The negative sign in this equation, indicates that the gun moves
backward, i.e. opposite to the bullet. It is because of the backward motion of the
gun that the shooter gets a jerk on his shoulder.

 Example 3.6
       A ball of mass 3 kg moving with a velocity of 5 ms−1 collides with a
stationary ball of mass 2 kg and then both of them move together. If the friction is
negligible, find out the velocity with which both the balls will move after collision.

 Solution
Mass of first ball                             = m1 = 3 kg
Velocity of first ball before collision        = v 1= 5 m s−l
Mass of second ball                            = m2 = 2 kg
Velocity of second ball before collision = v2 = 0
Velocity of both the balls after collision = v = ?
Total mass of balls after collision            = m1 + m
By      law        of        conversion         of       momentum,
Total momentum before collision = Total momentum after collision
or                      m₁ v₁ + m2 v2 = (m₁ + m ) v
       Putting the values,
                       3 kg × 5 m s−l + 0 = (3 kg + 2 kg) v
                       15 kg m s−l = 5 kg × v
                               v = 3 m s−l

   A force is a push or a pull that starts, stops and changes the magnitude and direction
    of velocity of a body.
   A contact force is a force that acts at the point of contact between two objects.
   Non-contact force is a force between two objects which are not in physical contact.
   Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear
    force are the four fundamental forces in nature.
   Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly
    proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square
    of the distance between them. This is known as Newton’s law of gravitation.
   Newton's first law of motion states that a body continues its state of rest or of uniform
    motion with the same constant velocity, unless acted upon by some net external
    force.
   The property of a body to maintain its state of rest or of uniform motion is called
    inertia.
   The second law of motion states that when a net force acts upon a body, it produces
    an acceleration in the direction of force and the magnitude of acceleration is directly
    proportional to the force and is inversely proportional to the mass.
   The third law of motion states that to every action there is an equal but opposite
    reaction.
   Action and reaction do not act on the same body but act on two different bodies.
   Mass of a body is the quantity of matter in it. It determines the magnitude of
    acceleration produced when a force acts on it. Mass of a body does not vary. It is a
    scalar quantity and its unit is kilogram (kg).
   The weight of an object is equal to the force with which the Earth attracts a body
    towards its centre.
   Force meter is a scientific instrument that measures force in newtons (N).

   The resisting force between the two surfaces before the motion starts is called the
    static friction. The maximum value of the static friction is called a limiting friction.
   The friction during motion is called kinetic friction.
   When a body moves with the help of wheels, the friction in this case is known as
    rolling friction. Rolling friction is much less as compared to the sliding friction.
   Energy is wasted in doing work against friction that appears in the form of heat.
   When upward air resistance balances the downward force of gravity on a falling
    object, it falls down with constant (safe) velocity, it is called terminal velocity.
   The product of mass and velocity of a moving body is called momentum.
   The principle of conservation of momentum states that if no external force acts on an
    isolated system, the final total momentum of the system is equal to the initial total
    momentum of the system.
   Impulse is defined as the product of F × Δ t = m × ΔV = total change in momentum.

      •    [SLO: P-09-B-53] Identify the sources of centripetal force in real life examples [e.g.,
           tension in a string for a stone being swirled around, gravity for the Moon orbiting the
           Earth]

        As we know, a force is a vector quantity, so it acts in a particular direction.
We observe various effects of forces. Some forces produce acceleration or
decelerating in a body, some tend to turn it around a point and some forces
balance each other acting in opposite directions.
        All those forces which act parallel to one another are known as parallel
forces. The points of application of such forces may be different.
                                                   80
    4.1 Like and Unlike Parallel Forces
         If the parallel forces are acting in the same
direction, then they are called like parallel forces and      F1                         FF22
if their directions are opposite to one another, they
are called unlike parallel forces. Three forces F1, F2
and F3 are shown in Fig. 4.1 acting on a rigid body at
different points. Here, the forces F1 and F2 are like                               F3
parallel forces but F2 and F3 are unlike parallel forces.                Fig. 4.1
    4.2 Addition of Forces
       In chapter 2, we have learnt about vectors and their representation.
Remember that the resultant is the same for any order of addition of vectors. As
forces are vectors, so forces can also be added by head-to-tail rule.
       To determine the resultant of two or more forces acting in a plane, the
following example will explain its method.
 Example 4.1
       Let us add three force vectors F1, F2 and F3 having magnitudes of 200 N,
300 N and 250 N acting at angles of 30O, 45O, 60O with x-axis. By selecting a
suitable scale 100 N = 1 cm, we can draw
the force vectors as shown in Fig. 4.2(a).                                F₃
       To add these vectors, we apply
                                                  y

 4.3 Turning Effect of a Force
        We have learnt so far that a net force affects the liner motion of an object
by causing it to accelerate. Since rigid objects can also rotate, so we need to
extend our concept to the turning effect of a force. When we open or close a
door, we apply force. This force rotates the door about its hinge. This is called
turning effect of force. Similarly, we use turning effect of force when we open or
close a water tap. Let us define some terms used in the study of turning effect of a
force.
        If the distance between two points of the body remains the same under
the action of a force, it is called a rigid body.                Axis of rotation
                                                                        z
        During rotation, all the particles of the rigid body                     A Rigid
rotate along fixed circles as shown in Fig. 4.3. The straight                 B    body
line joining the centres of these circles is called the axis of
                                                                                       y
rotation. In this case, it is OZ. To observe the turning effect         o
                                                                  x Fig. 4.3
of a force, let us perform an activity.
Activity 4.1
          Take your class to play ground where                        Pivot
 a see-saw is available. Let a lighter child sits
 on the left side and the heavier one on the             Moment arm         Moment arm
 right side of the see-saw. The distances of
 both the children from the pivot should be equal. The force exerted by each child is equal to his
 weight acting downward. Does the heavier child move down? Yes, because he is exerting
 larger force. Now move the heavier child nearer to the pivot and the lighter child away from
 the pivot as shown in the figure. Ask the students what do they observe?

       You will see that the see-saw tilts to the opposite direction and the lighter
child moves down. This shows that the turning effect of a force does not depend
only on its magnitude but also on the location where it acts. Therefore, we can
say that the greater the force, the greater is its turning effect. Moreover, the
larger the perpendicular distance of the force from the axis of rotation, the
greater is its turning effect.
                       The line along which the force acts is
                       called the line of action of the force.
        The perpendicular distance of the line of action of a force from the axis
       of rotation is known as moment arm of the force or simply moment arm.

        The moment arms of both the children are shown in the figure of
activity 4.1. There are many other examples to observe the turning or rotational
effect of a force. It is harder to open a door by pushing it at a point closer to the
                                                82
hinge as compared to push it at the handle (Fig. 4.4). That is why, door or window
handles are always installed at larger distances from hinges to
produce larger moment of force by applying less force. This makes
the doors be opened or closed more easier. Similarly, it requires
greater force to open a nut by a spanner if you hold it closer such as
point A than point B (Fig. 4.5).  F

       The turning effect of a force is measured by a
quantity known as moment of force or torque.                                 O r=ℓ                  P
                                                                              axis
    Moment of a force or torque is defined as the
     product of the force and the moment arm.                                    Fig. 4.6

       The magnitude of torque is given by                             Do You Know?

that the torque of a force is zero when the line of action of a force passes through
the axis of rotation, because its moment arm becomes zero. The torque is
positive if the force tends to produce an anticlockwise rotation about the axis,
and it is taken as negative if the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation. The
SI unit of torque is newton metre (N m).
        In many cases, the line joining the axis of rotation and point P where the
force F acts, is not perpendicular to the force F. Therefore, OP will not be the
moment arm for F. In such cases, we have to find a component of force F
perpendiculars to OP = (Fig. 4.7), or we can find r the component of that is
perpendicular to the (line of action) force F (Fig. 4.8).

For this, we need to know the method of finding rectangular components of a
force or any vector. This is also called as resolution of Forces.
 Couple
        A couple is a special type of torque. We observe at many situations in our
daily life, when two equal and opposite parallel forces produce torque. For
example, while opening or closing a water tap,
                                                                          F2
turning key in the lock, opening the lid of a jar and
                                                           A r1 O r2
turning steering wheel of a motor car, we apply a                         B

pair of equal forces in opposite directions. The
torque produced in this way in known as couple.                 Fig. 4.9

            When two equal and opposite parallel forces act at two
            different points of the same body, they form a couple.
                    Steering wheel of vehicles
 While turning a vehicle, a couple is applied on the steering
 wheel. It is interesting to know that now-a-days, steering
 wheels of smaller diameter are installed in vehicles. The reason
 is that, most of the fvehicles are provided with power steering
 in which a pump pushes hydraulic fluid to reduce the force
 needed to turn the wheels, resulting in effortless steering.

 Example 4.2
      A spanner 25 cm long is used to open a nut. If a force of 400 N is applied at
the end of a spanner shown in Fig. 4.10, what is the torque acting on the nut?
 Solution
Length of Spanner       = 25 cm = 0.25 m                                  F
                 Force =   F = 400 N
                Torque     τ=?                         Fig. 4.10
From Eq. (4.1),            τ=F×
Putting the values,        τ = 400 N × 0.25 m =100 N m

 4.4 Resolution of Vectors
       By head-to-tail rule, two or more vectors can be added to give a resultant
vector. Its reverse process is also possible, i.e., a given vector can be divided into
two or more parts. These parts are called as components of the given vector. If
these components are added up, their resultant is equal to the given vector. To
divide a force into its components is known as resolution of a force.
                                               84
        Usually, a force is resolved into two                       Beam of light
components which are perpendicular to
each other. These are called its perpendicular

        The x and y components can be practically drawn simply by dropping
perpendiculars from the tip of vector F onto x and y-axes respectively. The
x-component of force F is denoted as Fx and y-component as Fy.
        From Fig. 4.11(b), it is evident that F is the resultant vector of components
Fx and Fy. Moreover, Fx and Fy are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, Fx and Fy
are called perpendicular components of vector F.
        The magnitudes of the perpendicular components can be found from the
right angled triangle OAC in Fig. 4.11(b).                     Do You Know?

 4.6 Principle of Moments
        To understand the principle of moments, let us perform an activity.
Activity 4.2
          Balance a metre rule on a wedge at its centre of gravity such that the rule stays
 horizontal. Suspend two weights w 1 and w 2 on one side of the metre rule at distance and
   2
     from the centre and a third weight w 3 on the other side at distance until the rule is again
  balanced.
                                          1                                            3

           The weights w1 and w2 tend to rotate the rod anticlockwise about CG and the
   weight w3 tends to rotate it clockwise. The values of the moments of the weights are
   w1 × 1 , w × 2 and w × 3. When the metre rule is balanced, then
   Total anticlockwise moments = Total clockwise moments

                  w1 ×   1    + w2   2   = w3 ×   3    … .......................... (4.6)
  This is known as principle of moments, which is stated as:

         When a body is in balanced position, the sum of clockwise moments about
           any point equals the sum of anticlockwise moments about that point.

freely. One force of magnitude 18 N is applied perpendicular to the length of the
stick at its free end. Another force of magnitude 60N is acting at an angle of 30O

torques balance each others, i.e τ 1= τ2 or F y × d= F ‘× d‘

 4.7 Centre of Gravity and Centre of Mass
        An object is composed of a large number of small particles. Each particle is
acted upon by the gravitational force directed towards the centre of the
Earth (Fig. 4.14-a). As the object is small as compared to the Earth, the value of g
can be taken as uniform over all particles. Therefore, each particle experiences
the same force mg. Since all these forces are parallel and act in the same

       We know that the sum of the gravitational forces acting on all particles is
equal to the total weight of the object w = Mg Where M = ∑ m = mass of the
object.
                     Centre of gravity is that point where total
                     weight of the body appears to be acting.
       If a body is supported at its centre of gravity, it stays there without
rotation. The centre of gravity of an object of regular shape lies at its geometrical
centre. Centre of gravity of some geometrical shapes is given in Table 4.1.

       Newton’s second law of motion is applicable to
single particle or system of particles. Even when the
parts of a system have different velocities and                             CG

acceleration could be found by applying second law.             Centre of gravity of a bowl

This point is called the centre of mass of the system.

             The centre of mass of a body is that point where the
            whole mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated.
         Hence, the centre of mass behaves as if all the mass of the body or system
is lying at that point. In the (Fig. 4.16) given below, a rotating wrench slides along
a frictionless floor. There is no resultant force on the wrench. Therefore, its centre
of mass, shown by a yellow dot, follows a linear path with constant speed.

       On the surface of the Earth, where g is almost uniform, the centre of mass
of an object coincides with its centre of gravity.

 4.8 Equilibrium
       We have learnt how translatory and rotational motion can be caused due
to the application of external forces. Now, we shall see how external forces can be
balanced to produce no translational or                      Do You Know?
rotational effects.
    We know that if a number of forces act on a
body such that their resultant is zero, the body
remains at rest or continues to move with
uniform velocity if already in motion. This state
of the body is known as equilibrium, which can             This is a fascinating
be stated as:                                             scene of equilibrium.

          A body is said to be in equilibrium if it has no acceleration.

There are two types of equilibrium:
(i) Static equilibrium    (ii) Dynamic equilibrium
    A body at rest is in static equilibrium whereas a body moving with uniform
velocity is in dynamic equilibrium.

       An example of static equilibrium is a book lying on the table as shown in
the Fig. 4.17. Only two forces are acting on it. One is its weight w = mg acting
                                             90
downward and the other is Fn the normal force that the
table exerts upward on the book. Since the book is at rest
so, it has zero acceleration. Therefore, the sum of all the
forces acting on the book should be zero, so that the
book is said to be in equilibrium. Hence

                               Fn − w = 0                                  Fig. 4.17
                         or         Fn = w                      Book is in static equilibrium

        This means that forces can act on a body without
accelerating it, provided these forces balance each                          Rope

other.                                                        Wall

        An electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a                     Beam
room, a man holding a box, a beam held horizontal
against a wall with the help of a rope and a hanging                   Fig. 4.18 Weight
 weight (Fig. 4.18), are all examples of static equilibrium. A beam projected from a wall
                                                              is also in static equilibrium
        A good example of dynamic equilibrium is a
  paratrooper (Fig. 4.19). In a few second after the free
 fall, the parachute opens and a little later, the
paratrooper starts descending with a uniform velocity.
In this state, the force of gravity acting vertically
downward on the paratrooper is balanced by the
resistance of air on the parachute acting upward.                        Fig. 4.19

 4.9 Conditions of Equilibrium                          A paratrooper is in dynamic equilibrium
                                                                  Fascinating Freefall
       There are two conditions of equilibrium:
 First Condition of Equilibrium
        By Newton’s second law of motion, F = ma
If the body is in translational equilibrium, then a = 0,
therefore, net force F should be 0 or ∑F=0 ........ (4.7)
        This is the mathematical form of the first
condition of equilibrium which states that:                  A group of paratroopers making
                                                             in a formation-an example of
                                                                  dynamic equilibrium.

         A body is said to be in translational equilibrium only if the vector
             sum of all the external forces acting on it is equal to zero.
       In case a number of coplanar forces F1, F2, F3, .... having their resultant
equal to F, are acting on a body, these can be resolved into their rectangular
                                             91
components, and first condition of equilibrium can be then written as:
Along x-direction,      F 1x + F 2x + F +…… = 0
or                                        ∑ Fx = 0  …… (4.8)
Similarly, along y-direction,
                       F 1y + F 2y + F + …… = 0
or                                       ∑ Fy = 0   ……(4.9)
       Thus, first condition of equilibrium can also be stated as:

  The sum of all the components of forces along x-axis should be zero and
  the sum of all the components of forces along y-axis should also be zero.

 Second Condition of Equilibrium
        The second condition of equilibrium implies to the rotational equilibrium
which means that the body should not rotate under the action of the forces.
        Consider the example of a rigid body in Fig.4.20. Two forces F1 and F2 of
equal magnitude are acting on it. In case (a), both the forces act along the same
line of action.
                                                      F2       B
               F2      A    o    B
                                                           o
                                         F1
                                                               A   F1
                           (a)            Fig. 4.20        (b)

        In case (b), the lines of action of the two forces are different. Since
magnitude of F1 and F2 are equal, so the resultant force is zero in both the cases.
Thus, first condition of equilibrium is satisfied. But you can observe that in case
(b), the forces are forming a couple which can apply torque to rotate the body
about point O. Therefore, for a body to be completely in equilibrium, a second
condition is also required. That is, no net torque should be acting. This is the
second condition of equilibrium which can be stated as:
                    The vector sum of all the torques acting on
                      a body about any point must be zero.
Mathematically, we can write:             ∑τ=0                     ……(4.10 )
Hence, a body will be in complete equilibrium when,

                                     {
                                 ∑ Fx = 0
                                 ∑ Fy = 0
                    And           ∑τ=0

 Solving Problems by Applying Conditions of Equilibrium
   The following steps will help to solve problems by          Do You Know?
applying conditions of equilibrium.
1.     First of all, select the objects to which Eqs. (4.8)
       and (4.9) are to be applied. Each object should
       be treated separately.
2.     Draw a diagram to show the objects and
       forces acting on them. Only the forces acting         Most balancing toys
       on the objects should be included. The forces have a low centre of mass.
       which the objects exert on their environment should not be included.
3.     Choose a set of x, y axes such that as many forces as possible lie directly
       along x-axis or y-axis, it will minimize the number of forces to be resolved
       into components.
4.     Resolve all the forces which are not parallel to either of the axes, in their
       rectangular components.
5.     Apply Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) by putting ∑ Fx = 0 and ∑ Fy = 0 to get two
       equations.
6.     If needed, apply Eq. (4.10) by putting ∑τ = 0 to get another equation.
7.     The equations can be solved simultaneous to find out desired unknown
       quantities.

its centre of gravity. Find the tension T1 & T2 in
the two strings.

 Solution

negative whereas torque τ2 of w is positive about point B. T2 produces zero
torque as it passes through the point of rotation. Hence,
                                τ2 − τ1          = 0
    or                  w × BO − T1 × AB = 0
putting the values,      w × 0.2 m − T1 × 0.4 m = 0
   or                   5 N × 0.2 m − T1 × 0.4 m = 0
                         5 N × 0.2 m
    or              T1 =                  = 2.5 N
                             0.4 m
   Putting the value of T1 and w in Eq. (i), we have
               2.5 N + T2 − 5 N = 0
    or                         T2 = 2.5 N
 4.10 States of Equilibrium
    An object is balanced when its centre of mass and its point of support lie on
the same vertical line. Then forces on each side are balanced, and the object is
said to be in equilibrium. There are three states of equilibrium in connection with
stability of the balanced bodies.
 Stable Equilibrium
             A body is said to be in a state of stable equilibrium, if
             after a slight tilt, it comes back to its original position.
     Stable equilibrium occurs when the torques arising from the rotation (tilt) of
the object compel the body back towards its equilibrium position.
     The cone shown in Fig 4.22(a) is in the state of stable equilibrium. Its weight w
acting downward at the centre of gravity
G and the reaction of the floor Fn acting
upward, lie on the same vertical line.                  nF
                                                                      nF      G
Since these forces are equal and in                        G
opposite direction, so they balance each                 w
                                                                           w

other and both the conditions of                       (a)                  (b)
                                                              Fig. 4.22
equilibrium are satisfied.
     As you try to push over the cone slightly, its centre of gravity is raised but it
still remains above the base of the cone. The weight w and the normal force Fn do
not remain in the same line but act like two unlike parallel forces. The cone does
not remain in equilibrium. Unlike parallel forces produce a clockwise torque
which brings the cone back to its original position. It is worth noting that the
body remains in equilibrium as long its centre of mass lies within the base.

                                          94
 Unstable Equilibrium
     Try to balance the cone on its tip. It is balanced for a moment because w and
Fn lie along the same line. Even it is slightly tilted, it will not come back to its
original position by itself. Rather it will fall downward, because its centre of mass
no longer remains above the base. It
topples over, because line of action of w no
longer lies inside the base O (Fig. 4.23). In             G                 G

this case, centre of gravity is lowered on                w                  w

tilting and continues to fall further. It                  O                    O

                                                          n
                                                                         (b)   F       n

anticlockwise torque produced by w
moves it further downward.
      A body is said to be in a state of unstable equilibrium if, after a slight
          tilt, it tends to move on further away from its original position.
 Neutral Equilibrium
    A cylinder resting on a horizontal surface (Fig. 4.24) shows the neutral
equilibrium. If the cylinder is rotated slightly, there is no force or torque that
brings it back to its original position or moves it away. As the       F          n




cylinder rotates, the height of the centre of mass remains           G
unchanged. In any position of the cylinder, its weight and
reaction of the ground lie in the same vertical line.                  w Fig. 4.24


         A body is in neutral equilibrium if it comes to rest in its new
      position after disturbance without any change in its centre of mass.
   Other examples of neutral equilibrium are a ball rolling
on a horizontal surfaces, or a cone resting on its curved
surface (Fig.4.25).                                                          Fig. 4.25

position of centre of gravity is very important when
we are talking about stability. A bus can be stable or
unstable depending on how it is loaded. If the heavy
loads are placed on the floor of the bus, its centre of
gravity will be low. Now if it is disturbed slightly, a
                                                              A double decker bus is being

   In this case, the bus is in stable equilibrium. If the same bus is loaded with
steel sheets on the top, the centre of gravity be raised. It is now near to a state of
unstable equilibrium. A couple will turn it over if it is slightly tilted. The same is the
case of ships and boats. We can improve the stability of a system either by
lowering the centre of gravity or by widening the base.

        An unstable equilibrium is illustrated in this
        figure. A chair in normal position is quite

        The concept of stability is widely applied to engineering technology
especially in manufacturing racing cars and balancing toys.
        As the racing cars are driven at very high speeds and also there are sharp
turns in the track, therefore, the chances of the cars to topple over increase. To
enhance the stability of racing cars, their centres of mass are kept as low as
possible. There base areas are also increased by keeping the wheel outside of
their main bodies. Balancing toys are also very interesting for both children and
elders. Look at some balancing toys shown belows.




                         (a)                                   (b)                      (c)
                                   Fig. 4.26: Balancing toys
       The physics behind these types of toys is that stability is built in with
balancing toys. These toys are basically in completely stable state and their
centres of gravity always remain below the pivot point. If the toys are disturbed in
any direction, the centre of gravity is raised and it becomes unstable for a
moment. It comes back to its initial stable position by lowering its centre of
gravity.
                                               96
    The kids learn from these toys about stable systems and how they return to
their state of initial rest position after being disturbed. Educational games on the
basis of balancing toys have also been developed for the kids as
shown in Fig 4.27.
                                             Interesting Information!
                                          To enhance the
                                          stability of a
                                          racing car, its
                                          centre of mass is
                                          kept as low as
                                          possible. Its
                                          base area is also increased by keeping its
                                          wheels outside of its main body.
                Fig. 4.27
 Rotational Motion Versus Translatinal Motion
       Counterparts of velocity, acceleration, force and momentum in
translational motion are angular velocity, angular acceleration, moment of force
(torque) and angular momentum respectively in rotational motion. It suggests
that the torque plays the same role in the rotational motion that is played by the
force in the translational motion. Therefore, we are justified to predict that
analogous to Newton's first law of motion, a rotating object will continue to do
so with constant angular velocity unless acted upon by a resultant moment
(torque). However, if a resultant torque is applied to rotating object, it will
accelerate depending on the direction of the torque relative to the axis of
rotation.
       This fundamental principle enhances our understanding how objects
move and interact with their environment whether in linear or rotational motion
scenarios.
 Motion in a Circle
       When a body is moving along a circular path, its
velocity at any point is directed along the tangent
                                                                                        v
drawn at that point. Figure 4.28 shows that the direction
of tangent at each point on a circle is different,                                  F
therefore, the velocity of an object moving with uniform
speed in a circle is changing constantly. Hence, a force
perpendicular to the direction of motion is always                      Fig. 4.28

required to keep the object moving with uniform speed in a circular path.

                                        97
          It should be noted that F is essentially perpendicular to v. For an instance,
if it is not perpendicular to v, the force F will have a component in the direction of
v. This will change the magnitude of velocity. As the body moves with constant
speed, so it is possible only if the component of force along v is F cos 90° = 0.

 4.13 Centripetal Force
        We have studied above that an object can move in a circular path with
uniform speed only if a force perpendicular to its velocity is acting constantly on
it. This force is always directed towards the centre of the circle. It is called
centripetal force and can be defined as:
              The force that causes an object to move in a circle at
                 constant speed is called the centripetal force.

       For an object of mass m moving with uniform speed v in circle of radius r,
the magnitude of centripetal force Fc acting on it can be calculated by using the
relation:
                            mv2
                        Fc = r   . .......... (4.11)

 Example 4.5
       A 150 g stone attached to a string is whirled in a horizontal circle at a
constant speed of 8 m s-1. The length of string is 1.2 m. Calculate the centripetal
force acting on the stone. Neglect effects of gravity.
 Solution
               Mass of stone          = m = 150 g = 0.15 kg
               Speed of stone         = v = 8 m s -1
               Radius of circle = r =     1.2 m
               Centripetal force = Fc= ?

                              Fc= mv
                                     2

Using Eq.4.11,
                                   r
                                  0.15 kg × (8 m s-1)2
Putting the values,           Fc=                      =8N
                                        1.2 m

 Sources of Centripetal Force
       We have learnt that centripetal force has to be
supplied if the body is to be maintained in its circular              (a)
path. What could be the sources of centripetal force?          Fig. 4.29

                                                    A stone whirled in a circle by a string
                                          98
        If we tie a stone to one end of a string and whirl it from the other end, we
will have to exert a force on the stone through the string (Fig 4.29-a). If we release
the string when it is at any point P, the stone will fly                   Q
off along the tangent (PQ) to the circle. Then, it will                         v
                                                                                  P
move along the same straight line with constant
velocity unless an unbalanced force acts upon it.                           T
        In fact, the tension T in the string was                       O
providing the stone the necessary centripetal force
to keep it along the circular path (Fig 4.29-b).
When we release the string we stop applying force
on the stone and hence it moves in a straight line.                Fig. 4.29 (b)


       Now consider the case of the moon which
moves around the Earth at constant speed. The
gravity of the Earth provides the necessary
centripetal force to keep it in its orbit. Same is the
case of satellites orbiting the Earth in circular paths
with uniform speed. The gravitational pull of the                  Fig. 4.30
Earth provides centripetal force.                         A satellite orbiting the Earth

        One of the real life examples is a washing
machine dryer. A dryer is a metallic cylinderical
drum with many small holes in its walls. Wet clothes
are put in it. When the cylinder rotates rapidly,
friction between clothes and drum walls provides
necessary centripetal force. As the water molecules
are free to move, so they cannot get the required                 Fig. 4.31
centripetal force to move in circular paths and                Washing machine
escape from the drum through the holes. This
results into quick drying of clothes.

       Another interesting example is that of a
cream separator. In a cream separator, milk is
whirled rapidly.


                                                                Cream seperator
                                                                     Fig. 4.32
                                         99
       The lighter particles of cream experience less centripetal force and gather
in the central part of the machine. The heavier particles of milk need greater
centripetal force to keep their circular motion in circles of small radius r. In this
way, they move away towards the walls.

         Work and energy are important
concepts in physics as well as in our everyday
life. Commonly the word ‘work’ covers all sort
of activities whether mental or physical. If a
girl is studying (Fig. 5.1) or a man is standing
(Fig. 5.2) with a load of bricks on his head, we
say that they are doing work. But according to
physics, work has a specific definition. Work is                 Fig. 5.1
said to be done when a force acts on an object
and moves it through some distance.
The concept of energy is closely associated with that of
work, when work is done by one system on another,
energy is transferred between the two systems.
         In this chapter, we will define work, energy, power
and efficiency and show how they are related to one
another.

5.1 Work                                                                    Fig. 5.2

Force and distance are two essential elements of work. When a constant force
acting on a body moves it through some distance, we say that 'the force has done
work'.
              Work is defined as the product of magnitude of force
              and the distance covered in the direction of force.
       Consider a block of wood lying on a
table (Fig. 5.3). If we exert a force F on the
block to move it through a distance S in the                     F                     F
direction of force, then the work W done by
the force is:                                                         S
Work = Magnitude of force × Distance                             Fig. 5.3
or      W = F × S.....................(5.1)
From Eq. (5.1), it can be concluded that if some force is
acting on a body but there is no displacement, then no
work is done. For example, a man is pushing hard a wall
but the wall remains fixed in its place. In this case, the man
is doing no work (Fig. 5.4).
Similarly, if a force acting on the body is zero and the body
is moving with uniform velocity, work will be zero.
       As F = 0   so    W=0×S=0                                         Fig. 5.4

                                         106
What will be the work done when a force is
                                                                   F                       F
acting on a body making an angle θ with the
                                                               θ                       θ
direction of motion? In this case, work is done
due to the component of force which is acting         F cosθ
                                                                            S
along the direction of motion (Fig. 5.5).                              Fig. 5.5
Resolving the force F into its components, we have
the component F cosθ that acts in the direction of motion. Therefore,
                               W = (Fcosθ) S
                        or     W = FS cos θ …… (5.2)
If θ is zero, cos 0° = 1, then
                              W = FS (1) = FS

This is the case when force and distance covered
are in the same direction. Now if θ = 90°, then       Force
                                                        F
cos 90° = 0 which means the force has zero
component in the direction of motion. Thus,                        θ 90O

                                                                                   Displacement
                     W = FS (0) = 0                                                     S
         This is the case when force is perpendicular
to the displacement. Look at Fig. 5.6, it suggests
that if a person carries a bag to some distance, this
work is zero, because the force applied to hold the                     Fig. 5.6
load is upward which is perpendicular to the displacement.
        The work done to push an object is the same whether the object moves
north to south or east to west, provided the magnitude of force and the distance
moved are not changed. Work does not convey any directional information, so it
is a scalar quantity.

Calculation of Work Done by Graph
       When a constant force F acts through a distance S,       P                                 Q

the event can be plotted on a force-distance graph as                      Shaded area
shown in Fig. 5.7. If the force and distance covered are in F               work done
the same direction, the work done is F × S.                 Force
       Clearly the shaded area in the figure is also F × S.     O
                                                                             Dis tance            R
Hence the area under a force distance curve can be taken                        S
to represent the work done by that force.                                    Fig. 5.7

                                        107
Units of Work
The SI unit of work is joule (J).
    One joule work is done when a force of one newton acting on a body
    moves it through a distance of one metre in its own direction.
From Eq. (5.1)
               1J=1N×1m
       or      1J=Nm
Bigger units are also used like     1 kJ = 10 J   and   1MJ = 106 J

 Example 5.1

5 metres. How much force is applied by him?
 Solution
Work done               W = 200 J

From Eq. (5.1)       W = F × S or F =
                                      S
Putting the values, we get
                         200 J
                     F=        = 40 N

       Find the work done by a 65 N force in pulling the suitcase (Fig. 5.8) for a
distance of 20 metres.

Distance covered            S = 20 m

        Our body cannot move unless we have energy
from food. A car would not run without the energy it
obtains from burning fuel. Machines in the factories
cannot run without consuming energy supplied by
electricity. Any change in motion requires energy. When
we say that a certain body has energy, we mean that it
has the ability of doing work.
                                                                    A stretched bow stores
Energy can be defined as the ability of a body to do work.               energy, which is
                                                                    transferred to the arrow
        When someone does work, energy of the body                  as it is shot. Some bows

on which work is done. In other words, the energy is
                                                                            1 km away.
transferred from one system to another. For example,
when you do work pushing a swing, chemical energy in your body is transferred
to the swing and appears as energy of the motion of the swing.
Like work, energy is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is joule (J).

When one joule work is done on a body, the amount of energy spent is one joule.
There are many forms of energy. Electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear
energy, heat energy and light energy are some well-known forms which we shall
study later on. There are two basic forms of energy:
       (i) Kinetic energy
       (ii) Potential energy

The combination of these two types of energies is called mechanical energy.

Kinetic Energy
                    The kinetic energy of a body is the energy
                    that a body possesses by virtue of its motion.
To find out how much kinetic energy a moving body possesses, an opposite
force can be applied on the body to stop its motion. Then the work done by
the force will be equal to the kinetic energy of the body. i.e., Kinetic energy
(E k ) = Work done (W)
Suppose a body of mass m is moving with velocity v. An opposing force F acting
on the body through a distance S brings it to rest. Then,

                                            109

Hence, E k = ma × 2 = 2 ma × vt                           (m s−1)
Using velocity-time graph (Fig 5.9), the acceleration                          t
                                                                O

Hence, a =

Potential Energy
       In the previous section, we have seen that the work done on a body is used
to increase its kinetic energy. Sometimes, the work done on a body does not
increase its kinetic energy, rather it is stored in the body as potential energy.
Potential energy is defined as the energy that a body            Do You Know?

possesses by virtue of its position or deformation.
Forms of Potential Energy:
There are many forms of potential energy. As
mentioned above, the energy possessed by an object
by virtue of its position relative to the Earth is known      The train is changing
                                                             potential energy every
as gravitational potential energy.                         moment in the roller coaster

                                          110
        The energy stored in a compressed or stretched spring is called elastic
potential energy and the potential energy in the chemicals of a battery is called
chemical potential energy, which is changed to electrical energy by chemical
reactions. Thermal or internal energy is released by burning fossil fuels i.e. coal,
oil or gas through chemical reactions.
        Nuclear energy is the hidden energy in the nuclei of atoms. When they
are broken, energy is released in the form of heat and some other radiations. This
is called nuclear fission.
        If the block shown in Fig. 5.10 is lifted to a height
h above the ground, then the block would have                  F
potential energy in that raised position. Therefore, it                    h
has the ability to do work whenever it is allowed to fall.
How should potential energy be measured? Because                    Fig. 5.10
                                                                 w
work is done on the block to put it into the position where it has potential energy,
therefore, we can say that the work done is stored in it as potential energy. Thus,
potential energy Ep is given by
               E p = Work done to put the block in elevated position
       The applied force necessary to lift the block with constant velocity is equal
to weight w of the block and since w = mg, therefore, potential energy of the
block at height h becomes,
       E p = wh
or     E p = mgh ....................... (5.4)
        The most obvious example of
gravitational potential energy is a waterfall

5.3 Conservation of Energy
       The study of various forms of energy and the transformation of one kind
of energy into another has led to a very important principle known as the
principle of conservation of energy. Formally, it is stated as:

        Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It may be transformed from
 one form to another, but the total amount of energy never changes.
        During energy transfer process, some energy seems to be lost and not
accounted for in calculations. This loss of energy is due to work done against
friction of the moving parts in the process. This energy appears as heat and is
dissipated in the environment. This energy does not remain available for doing
some useful work and may be called waste energy.
        A process of energy conversion and conservation can be described with
the given example.
        Let a body of mass m be at rest at a point A above the
                                                                    A
height h from the ground (Fig.5.12). Its total energy is P.E is mgh,
                             E p = mgh
and                          Ek = 0                                  B           h
Then the body is allowed to drop to point B at a height x from the
ground. The body lose potential energy and gains kinetic energy        x

negligible.                                                            Fig. 5.12
                             E p= mg (h − x)
The loss of potential energy will appear as the gain in kinetic energy, hence, at
point B
                             Ek= mgx
        Total energy at B    E = mg (h − x) + mgx = mgh
Just before hitting the ground at point C, the whole of potential energy is
changed into kinetic energy. Thus,
                      E p= 0 and E = mgh
       Thus, total energy remains the same as mgh. On hitting the ground, this
energy is dissipated as heat and sound in the environment.

Fossil Fuel Energy
        Fossil fuel energy comes out from burning of oil,
coal and natural gas. These materials are known as fossil
fuels. The burning of these fuels gives out heat which is
used to generate steam that runs the turbines to
produce electricity. A block diagram of the process                   Before electricity was

a lower place. Such a construction is known as dam.
The kinetic energy of running water rotates the turbine which in turn runs the
electric generator.

Solar Energy
       Sun is the biggest source of energy. The energy obtained from sunlight is
referred to as solar energy. Solar energy can be used in two ways. Either it can be
used for heating system or can be converted to electricity. In one way, solar
panels absorb heat of the Sun. They consist of large metal plates which are
painted black (Fig. 5.15). Heat can be used for warming houses or running water
heating system. If solar radiation is concentrated to a small surface area by using
large reflectors or lenses, reasonably high temperature can be achieved.

reactor. Heat produced by the fuel is used to make steam that runs the turbines
of electric generators. Pakistan also runs nuclear power stations at Karachi and
Chashma.

these rocks is about 250°C. This energy is
known as geothermal energy which can be                                 Hot rocks

To make use of the heat of the rocks, two
holes are drilled up to the rocks. Cold water
is pumped down through one of the holes. It
is heated up by the hot rocks and starts
boiling. Steam is produced that comes out
through the other hole. The steam runs the
generator which produces electricity. Where
there is water already present over the hot                 Fig. 5.18
rocks, it comes out of the surface of the Earth in the form of hot springs and
geysers. Such a geyser is shown in Fig. 5.18.

                                       115
Wind Energy
         For thousands of years, people have
been using windmills to draw water from the
well or to grind grains into flour. The modern
windmill is used to run generators that
produce electricity. Wind generators make
electricity in the same way as steam generators
in power stations. For large scale power
generation, a 'wind farm' with a hundred or
more windmills is needed. A windmills farm
is shown in Fig. 5.19.                                  Fig. 5.19 Windmills farm

Energy from Tides
        The gravitational force for the moon gives rise to tides in the seas. The tide
raises the water level near the sea shore twice a day. The rise and fall of water can
be utilized to turn on turbine for electricity generation. The water at high tides
can be trapped at a suitable location, a basin, by building a dam. The water is
then released in a controlled way at low tide to drive the turbines for producing
electricity. At next high tide, the dam is filled again and the incoming water also
drives turbines.

Energy from Waves in Sea
       The tides and winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce strong
water waves.
        Their energy can be used to generate      Duck floats

electricity. The method to harness wave
energy is to use large floats which move up
and down with the waves. One such device
invented by Prof. Salter is known as Salter's
duck (Fig.5.20). It consists of two parts.        Waves

The energy of the water waves causes duck float to move relative to the balance
float. The relative motion of the duck float is used to drive the electricity
generators.

burnt to boil water and produce steam. The
steam can be used to generate electricity. In
another process, the rotting of biomass in a
closed tank called a 'digester' produces
methane rich biogas (Fig. 5.21). In this
process, micro-organisms break down

generation of hydroelectric power will never end up. Likewise, solar energy will
remain available forever. Same is the case with wind and tidal energy. These are
not going to run out in future.
Non-renewable sources include fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The remnants of
plants and animals buried under the Earth took millions of years to change into
fossil fuels. These fuels are in limited quantity. Once they are used up, it will take
further millions of years to form new ones. Similarly, fuels for the nuclear energy
are also limited.
As the need for energy is increasing day by day, there is need to develop other
non- traditional renewable energy sources.

5.6 The Advantages and Disadvantages
of methods of Energy production
The production of hydroelectric
power is more economical and
pollution free. The solar power, wind,
tidal and wave power need more
initial cost but they do not produce
pollution and are also economical as
well. On the other hand, power
generation by fossil fuels and nuclear
fuel adds to the pollution of
environment. Burning of fossil fuels                   Fig. 5.22
produces smoke, carbon dioxide gas Do You Know?
and heat (Fig. 5.22). They enhance Burning fossil fuels release five billion tonnes of
direct pollution to atmosphere. carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.
Wind-mills are very noisy. Some people think that wind turbines spoil the beauty
of landscape.
        Nuclear power generators are also run by steam produced by nuclear
heat energy. Heat itself is a form of pollution. Moreover, there is always danger of
leakage of the radioactive radiation which is harmful to living bodies. People
living around nuclear plants are always at risk. The disposal of nuclear waste is
another problem for the nuclear power generation. However, any form of waste
energy ends up as thermal energy that goes to the environment. Thus, thermal
pollution is increasing day by day causing global warming.

5.7 Power
       In many cases, the time to do work is as important as the amount of work
done. Suppose you walk up to a height ‘h’ through upstairs (Fig. 5.26). You do
work, because you are lifting your body up the stairs. If you run up, you can reach
the same height in a shorter time interval.




                                                  height (h)



                                      Fig. 5.26
The work done is the same in either case, because the net result is that you lifted
up the same weight w to the same height h. But you know that if you run up the
stairs, you would be more tired than you walked up slowly. In fact, there is a
difference in the rate at which work is done. We say that you expend more energy
when you go up the stairs rapidly than when you go slowly.
The concept of power can also be explained with another example of an electric
motor or a water pump. A bigger motor draws more water during the same
interval of time as compared to a smaller one. It is said that the power of bigger
motor is greater than that of smaller one.


                 Power is defined as the time rate of doing work.
Mathematically,
      Power = Work
                Time
If W is the work done in time t, then
      P = W................ (5.5)
            t
Power of any agency can also be defined as energy transferred per unit time.

Units of Power
      Since both work and time are scalar quantities, so according to Eq.(5.5)
power is also a scalar quantity. The SI unit of powers is watt (W).

         One watt is the work done at the rate of one joule per second.

       A 1000 kg car moving with an acceleration of 4 m s–2 covers a distance of
50 m in 5 seconds. What is the power generated by its engine?
Solution
Mass of car          m = 1000 kg
Acceleration         a = 4 m s–2
Distance             S = 50 m

The ratio of useful output energy and the total input
energy is called the efficiency of a working system.

                                    Total input energy
Efficiency is often multiplied by 100 to give percentage efficiency. Thus,
                                    Useful output energy
          Percentage Efficiency =                           × 100

                                      Total power input
It is found that the energy output is always less than the energy input. During any
conversion of energy, some energy is wasted in the form of heat. No device has
yet been invented that may convert all the input energy into required output.
That is why a system cannot have an efficiency of 100 %. As the energy losses are
inevitable in the working of a machine, hence, an ideal or perpetual machine
cannot be constructed.
     Perpetual Energy Machines
        It is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely, without any
external source of energy. A perpetual machine would have to generate more
energy than it consumes, effectively producing energy from nothing, which is
impossible. In any real mechanical system, some energy is always lost as heat due
to friction between moving parts and air resistance etc. Thus, making it
impossible for a machine to keep moving without an external source of energy.
Infact, it is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy that a
perpetual energy machine is not workable.

Example 5.6
A block weighing 120 N is dragged up a slope with a force of 100 N to lift it up a
height of 10 m. If the slope is 20 m long, calculate the efficiency of the system.
Solution
Weight of block       W = 120 N
Force applied         F = 100 N
Distance              S = 20 m                                                                10 m
Height                h = 10 m
% Efficiency             = ?
Work done to lift the block up is:
              W = F × S = 100 N × 20 m = 2000 J
Now, total input energy = work done on the block = 2000 J
Useful output energy = Gravitational potential energy gained = wh
                                 = 120 N × 10 m = 1200 J

        You have learnt in lower classes that every thing around us is made up of
matter. The matter normally exists in solid, liquid and gaseous states. These
states are due to attractive force that exist between the atoms and molecules. We
have already studied some basic properties of matter. In this chapter, we will
discuss mechanical properties of matter that are of vital importance for use of a
material for various useful purposes in technology and engineering. The main
contents included in this chapter are: deformation of solids due to some applied
force, density and pressure.
6.1 Deformation of solids
       We have observed that an external force applied
on an object can change its size or shape. Such a force is
known as deforming force. For example, an appropriate
force applied to a spring can increase its length called
extension or cause compression thus reducing its
length. If this force is removed, the spring will restore its
original size and shape. Similarly, stretched rubber strip
or band comes to its original shape and size on
removing the applied force.

(Fig. 6.1). They regain their original shape after

limit known as elastic limit. Beyond the elastic limit, the
change becomes permanent. The object or material does not regain its original
shape or size even after the removal of the deforming force.

6.2 Hooke’s law
       If force F is applied on a spring to stretch or compress it, the extension or
compression x has been found directly proportional to the applied force within
the elastic limit. Thus,    F∝x                          F .............
               or                              or    k=                  (6.1)
                            F = kx

                                          128
where k is the constant of proportionality and is known as spring constant. In fact,
it is a measure of stiffness of the spring. The greater the value of spring constant,
the greater will be the stiffness or strength of the
                                                                            A
spring. Its unit is N m-1.                                                   Elastic limit
         A graph of force against extension is a straight
line passing through the origin. If the applied force or       F
load exceeds the elastic limit of the spring, it is (N)
permanently deformed and its graph will no longer                O       x
remain linear. The gradient or slope of force-extension                 (m)
graph is a measure of spring constant k.
                                                                                Fig. 6.2
      Hooke’s law also holds when a force is applied to a straight thin wire or a
rubber band within its elastic limit.
 Activity 6.1

          The teacher will arrange a helical spring with an
attached pointer, slotted weights, half metre rule or
scale, iron stand and will facilitate to perform this activity
as per instructions. Note that a spring of helical or spiral
shape is called helical spring. Its length should be greater
than its diameter.
(i)       Suspend a helical spring with the stand.
(ii)      Adjust the pointer so that it does not touch the
          scale but can move up and down freely along
          the scale.
(iii)     Place a slotted weight say 50 g in the hanger and
          note the position of pointer on the scale.
(iv)      Repeat this step for five times, each time
          increasing the load in equal amount.
(v)       Draw a graph between force F along y-axis and
          extension along x-axis.
(vi)      What is the shape of the graph?
(vii)     What does it show?
(viii)    Find the slope of the straight line. What does it
          represent?

Applications of Hooke's Law
        Hooke's law serves as the basic principle in wide range of applications. In
the field of technology and engineering, springs in many devices rely on Hooke's
law for their functions such as spring scales, balance wheel of the mechanical
clocks, galvanometer, suspensions system in vehicles and motorbikes, door
hinges, mattresses, material testing machines, etc.
        However, Hooke's law applies within a
specific range of forces. Exceeding the range or
limit results in permanent deformation and no
longer follows Hooke's law. Some of the uses are
elaborated below:
1. Spring scales

of objects. In a common spring balance the                                Balancing
                                                                           spring
extension or elongation produced is a measure of
the weight. In compression balance, the spring is
compressed by the load (force) and the                                   Fig. 6.4
compression produced is measured by means of a
pointer moving over a scale. Weighing machine usually use this type of balance.
2. Balance wheel of mechanical clocks
    The balance wheel in mechanical clocks use spring to control the back and
forth motion that regulates the speed of the hands of a clock (Fig. 6.4).
3. Galvanometer
        Galvanometer is a current detecting
device. It makes use of a tiny spring called hair
spring (Fig. 6.5) which provides electrical
connections to the galvanometer coil and also
restores the pointer back to zero position. The
deflection of the pointer is proportional to the
current flowing through it within the range.

find that each of them has a different mass. That is, one centimetre cube of wood
may weigh only 0.7 g but made of iron will weigh 8.0 g. Why is it so? You know
that all substances are composed of molecules. The molecules of different
substances are different in size and mass. The inter-molecular spacing is also
different.
        The mass of equal volume of various substances actually is the mass of the
total number of molecules present in that volume. Naturally, the substance
whose molecules are densely packed and also which are heavy will weigh more
than others.
          Density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

       The area A on which the force acts is usually referred as contact area.
Equation (6.3) shows that for a certain force, the pressure can be very large if the
contact area A is small.
       In the system international, the unit of pressure is N m-2 and is called
pascal (Pa).

1. The edge of the blade of a chopper is made
   very sharp. When we apply force on the
   handle of the chopper to cut an object, the
   pressure on the object, at the contact

   high and the object is easily cut (Fig. 6.6).
2. The top of a thumb pin is flat but the end of
   the pin is very sharp. So, the contact area is
   very small. When we apply a force at the top,
   the pressure at the end of pin is so high that
   it pierces into the wooden board (Fig. 6.7).
3. When we walk on ground, we exert a force

6.5 Pressure in Liquids
        We have learnt in the lower classes that liquids exert pressure in all
directions. Moreover, liquid pressure increases with depth.
        Let us determine the pressure at a certain depth of a liquid. Figure. 6.8
shows a container of liquid. Consider an area A in the liquid at depth h. The force
acting on this area is equal to the weight of the liquid column over surface A. The
volume of this liquid is V = Ah. If ρ is the density of liquid, then mass m of the
liquid column will be:
                       m = ρV = ρAh
                                        133
Therefore, force acting on area A will be
F    =      mg      =    ρ        Ahg

liquid increases with depth. The value of pressure                      A
depends on the depth and density of the liquid.
        Pressure produces force at right angle to
the surface. A force or its component that is
parallel to the surface, does not contribute to
pressure. The pressure, by definition, is only            Fig. 6.8 Pressure in a liquid

contributed by the normal component of the force. That is, the forces in a liquid
that push directly against the surface and add up to a net force is perpendicular
to the surface. If there is a hole in the surface of the liquid container, the liquid
spurts at right angle to the surface before curving downward due to gravity.

 Example 6.3
        A cylindrical water tank 2 m deep has been built on the top of a building
20 m high. What will be the pressure of water at the ground floor when the tank is
full? Density of water is 1000 kg m-3. Take g = 10 m s-2.

 Activity 6.3
           Teacher should help the students to perform this
activity and initiate discussion as per instructions:
i. Make three small holes at different heights in the side of a
     container as shown in the given figure.
ii. Fill the container with water.
iii. Observe the water streams flowing out of the holes. It is
     initially normal to the surface.
iv. Which one of the streams hits the ground at larger
     distance?
v. At which position the liquid has more pressure?
You will observe that the stream from each hole, initially flows out normal to the surface before
curving down due to gravity and the lowest hole has more pressure. It shows that liquid pressure
increases with depth.

 Activity 6.4
          Teacher should demonstrate or help the students to
perform by following the instructions given below:
(i)       Fill a polythene shopping bag with water.
(ii)      Poke several holes by using a pin on the bag.
(iii)     Squeeze the bag gently.
(iv)      What do you observe?
          Squeezing the top of bag causes the water to squirt on
in all directions. It means the pressure is transmitted equally
throughout the liquid.

6.6 Atmospheric Pressure
        The Earth is surrounded by a layer of air which we call atmosphere. We
know that air is a mixture of gases. Their molecules are always in motion. They
collide with one another and with all other objects coming in their way. Thus, they
exert force on the objects. This force per unit area is the atmospheric pressure.
Since the molecules of air have random motion, therefore, atmospheric pressure
acts equally in all directions.
    The atmosphere exerts pressure on the surface of the Earth and on
    everything on the Earth. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure.

                                              135
        Atmospheric pressure extends up to a Do You Know?
height of about 100 kilometres. The density of air is The pressure of 1 atmosphere
                                                             is equivalent to placing a
not the same in the atmosphere. It decreases 1.0 kg mass (10 N weight) on
continuously with altitude.                  an area of 1 cm².

        We live at the bottom of the Earth's atmosphere which is a fluid that exerts
pressure on our bodies. At sea level, the value of atmospheric pressure is about
1.013 × 10 Pa. This value is referred to as standard atmospheric pressure. It is an
            5



enormous pressure which can crush anything. We do not feel it because
practically all the bodies have air inside them. As atmospheric pressure acts in all
directions, so it balances the pressure inside.

Evidence of Atmospheric Pressure
        We can observe the force of the atmospheric pressure if we remove the
inside air from a vessel as shown in the following activity.

 Activity 6.5

          The teacher should perform this activity in the
class following the instructions given.
          Boil some water in a tin can. When it is full of
steam, remove it from the burner and close its mouth by
an air tight cork. Then pour cold water over it. The can
crumples as shown in the given figure. Why does the tin
crumples?



Variation of Atmospheric Pressure with Height
       We have studied that pressure in a liquid increases with depth. At depth h,
the pressure of liquid is given by
                P = ρgh
       This formula is applicable to all the fluids. As the gases of the atmosphere
are also fluid, therefore, the atmospheric pressure should be maximum on the
ground at sea level. As we go up in the air, atmospheric pressure decreases. At a
height of about 5 km, it falls to 55 kPa and at a height of 30 km it falls to 1 kPa. By
measuring the atmospheric pressure at a point in air, altitude of that point can be
determined. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the greater is the altitude.

6.7 Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure
        Atmospheric pressure is usually measured by

Instruments which measure the atmospheric
pressure are called barometers. A simple mercury                                  Scale

long that is closed at one end. It is completely filled                               Air

(Fig. 6.9). The space in glass tube over the top of the
mercury is completely empty. The pressure is almost
zero.                                                           Fig 6.9 Barometer

Changes in Atmospheric Pressure as Weather Indicator
        The atmospheric pressure does not always Quick Quiz
remain uniform but flactuates. By observing the Can we use water in place
variation, the meteorologists can forecast the of mercury to construct a
weather conditions.                                      barometer? Explain why.
        Atmospheric pressure depends upon the
density of air. At high altitudes, where the air is less dense, the atmospheric
pressure falls down. Similarly, increase in the quantity of water vapours also
decreases the density. Thus, atmospheric pressure becomes low in cloudy
regions. Weather casters use this knowledge to predict rains. A fall in pressure
often means that rain clouds are on the way and the rain is to follow.
6.8 Measurement of Pressure by Manometer
       A simple manometer consists of a
U-shaped glass tube which contains mercury. In
the beginning, the atmospheric pressure at the
two open ends of the tube is the same and
hence, mercury level in the two arms remains
same (Fig. 6.10). If on connecting a gas cylinder
with short arm keeping the longer arm of the
tube open, the mercury level in short arm is
lower than that in the long arm (Fig. 6.11), then
the unknown pressure is more than the
atmospheric pressure. If the mercury level in the
short arm is more than the long arm (Fig.6.12),        Fig. 6.10 manometer
then the unknown pressure is less than the
atmospheric pressure.

        Let us perform a very interesting activity with a liquid. Take water in a flask
with piston and having a few side tubes fixed at different positions. If such flask is
not available you can join a syringe at the mouth of a pet bottle. For side tubes,
bendable transparent drinking straws can be glued on the holes punched on
sides of the bottle.
        You will observe that the level of water in all the side tubes is the same. This
is because a liquid seeks its own level and rises to
the same height at all points. Now push the piston                               Side
                                                              Piston
                                                                                 tubes
through some distance.
        The level of water in all the side tubes rises
to the same height. Why does this happen? This is
because the pressure applied at one point of the
liquid is transmitted equally to every point of the
liquid. Since gases (air) and liquids are termed as
fluids so the above activities prove that:

        When pressure is applied at one point in
        an enclosed fluid, it is transmitted             Flask                Water
        equally to all parts of fluid without loss.               Fig. 6.13

This is the statement of Pascal's law.
         The technology of hydraulic systems is based on Pascal's law. Its main
advantages are:
(I)      Liquids do not absorb any of the supplied energy.
(ii)     They are capable of moving much heavy loads and providing great forces
         due to incompressibility.
Some useful hydraulic systems are:
                             1. Hydraulic press
                             2. Car lift at service stations

Hydraulic Press
        Consider a specially designed container as shown in Fig. 6.14. In this
container there are two cylinders joined by means of a pipe. The cross-sectional
area of the smaller cylinder is A 1    F1
and that of the larger one is A 2.                                       F2
The cylinders are filled with some
incompressible liquid.
Suppose that the small piston is          Piston
                                      A1 area
pressed down by applying a

                                                                   Piston area
produced by small piston is
transmitted equally to the large
piston.                                                               Liquid
                                                Pipe
Due to this pressure P, a force F2,
will act on A2 , which is given by                   Fig. 6.14
                 F =PA

                              A1
       Since A₂ > A1, therefore, F₂ > F₁. The result indicates that a small force
applied on the smaller piston, results into a large force on the larger piston. Such
a system is known as force multiplier.
       A hydraulic press works on this principle. Cotton bale or any other object
to be compressed is placed over the larger piston. A force F₁ is applied on the
smaller piston. The pressure P produced by smaller piston is transmitted equally
to the larger piston. A much greater
force F2 acts on it. This force lifts the
larger piston and compresses the
cotton bale.
       This principle is also used at
service stations to lift cars for
washing (Fig. 6.15).

       The diameters of the pistons of a hydraulic press are 5 cm and 25 cm

Putting the values,
          w =160 N × (12.5 × 10-2 m)² / (2.5 × 10-2 m)² = 4000 N = 4 kN
So, we can lift 4000 N weight by applying a force of 160 N on smaller piston.

pistons to move outward pressing the brake pads towards brake discs or brake
drums. Force of friction between the pads and discs or drums slows down the
vehicle. When pressure is released from the pedal, the springs pull back the brake
pads and wheels again turn freely.

                                          KEY POINTS
         Elasticity is the property of solids by which they come back to their original
          shape when deforming force ceases to act.
         Within the elastic limit of a helical spring, the extension or compression in it is
          directly proportional to the applied force. This is known as Hooke's law.
         Density is defined as mass per unit volume.
      
          Pressure is the force that acts normally on unit area of a surface. Its SI unit is
          pascal = 1 N m-2
         Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the atmosphere acting on unit area
          of the Earth’s surface.
         Atmospheric pressure is measured by the column of mercury which the
          atmospheric pressure can support.
         If pressure is exerted on a liquid, the liquid transmits it equally in all directions.
          This is known as Pascal's law.

         Heat or thermal energy has always been the necessity of human beings,
animals and plants in this world. Without heat, their existence would not have
been possible. In the beginning, the Sun was the only source of light and heat.
With the discovery of fire, a new era was started. The uses of heat produced from
fire were increased day by day and contributed greatly to the comforts and
facilities for the human being. Initially, the hot and cold objects were sensed by
touching which was not a good standard to measure the degree of hotness of an
                                              148
object. So, man evolved different methods to measure it. After the invention of
standard measuring devices, the temperature was also included in the list of
basic physical quantities like mass, length and time.
        This chapter begins with the introduction of kinetic molecular theory of
particles of matter. It is due to the fact that temperature and heat or internal
energy are associated with the motion of particles in the matter.
7.1 Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter
        According to this theory, matter is composed of very small particles called
molecules which are always in motion. Their motion may be vibrational,
rotational or linear. There exists a mutual force of attraction between the
molecules known as intermolecular force. This force depends upon the distance
between the molecules. It decreases with increasing distance between them.
        The molecules possess kinetic energy due to motion and potential energy
due to force of attraction. When a substance is heated, its temperature rises and
its molecular motion becomes more vigorous which increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules. Thus, the temperature of the substance depends upon the
average kinetic energy of its molecules. In general, matter exists in three states
solids, liquids and gases as shown in Fig. 7.1.




                     Solid             Liquid            Gas
                                       Fig. 7.1
       Most of the properties of solids, liquids and gases
can be explained on the basis of kinetic molecular theory of
matter. In case of solids, the intermolecular forces are so
strong that they keep the molecules bound. So, the
molecules are held at fixed positions but still they show
vibrational motion about their fixed points (Fig. 7.2). This is
why, the solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.
       In case of liquids, intermolecular force is so weak that
it cannot hold the molecules at fixed positions and the            Fig. 7.2
molecules can slide over each other in random directions. A liquid, therefore,
possesses a definite volume but has no definite shape. Due to flow of the
molecules, it acquires the shape of the containing vessel.
       Gas molecules are relatively far away from one and another. Due to which,
gas neither posseses a definite volume nor a definite shape.
                                       149
Plasma
        The plasma is a gas in which most of the atoms
are ionized containing positive ions and electrons
(Fig. 7.3-a). They are freely moving in the volume of the
gas. Due to presence of positive ions and free electrons,
plasma is the conducting state of matter. It allows
electric current to pass through it. Since the gas in
plasma state has properties which are quite different
from ordinary gas, therefore, plasma is known as fourth       Fig. 7.3(a) Plasma
state of matter. The Sun and the most of other stars are in plasma state. Plasma is
also found in plasma TV and in gas discharge tubes (Fig. 7.3-b) when electric
current passes through them. The plasma state also occurs during the early
stages of lightning formation known as lightning streamers which are the
conducting paths through the atmosphere due to ionized air molecules.

7.2 Temperature and Heat
        When we touch ice, we feel cold. When we dip                                  Ice cubes
our fingers in warm water, we feel hot. Thus, by sense of
touch we can tell which of the bodies is colder or hotter.
A hotter body is said to be at higher temperature as
compared to a colder body.
         Temperature of a body is defined as degree
                of its hotness or coldness.
        It is our common experience that when we heat a
body, its temperature rises. Process of heating provides
heat or thermal energy to the body which is the cause                            Warm water
of the rise in temperature.                                                Fig. 7.4
        The following activity will help to define temperature.
 Activity 7.1
 The teacher should arrange hot water in some tea cups, thermometers and metal spoons.
 Make groups of the students. Each group will put the spoon in the hot water and stir it. Ask
 them what do they feel. Does the other end of the spoon also become hot?
                                             150
 Do they observe that the spoon also gets hotter? It means heat is being transferred from the
 hot water to the spoon because the temperature of the water was higher than that of the

 Thus
            Temperature can be defined as a physical quantity which
              determines the direction of flow of thermal energy.
        This means that thermal energy is transferred from one object to another
due to temperature difference of the two bodies. Therefore, we can define heat
as follows:
    Heat is the energy which is transferred from one object to another due to
    difference of temperature between the two bodies.

Temperature and Internal Energy
      We know that matter is composed
of molecules which are always in
motion. Molecules of a solid are
vibrating about their fixed positions.
The molecules of a liquid are sliding
one over the other and those of gases
are randomly moving. The molecules
possess kinetic energy on account of           Fig. 7.5 The internal energy of air

associated with molecules because of
their attractive forces.
                 The sum of kinetic and potential energies of the
                molecules of an object is called its internal energy.
      When we heat a substance, its molecular motion becomes more vigorous
which means an increase in its internal energy. As a result, temperature of the
substance rises. The heat energy transferred to a body increases the internal
energy of its molecules due to which its temperature rises.
      Remember that, it is not true to say that a substance contains heat. The
substance contains internal energy. The word heat is used only when referring to
the energy actually in transit from hot to cold body.

7.3 Thermometers
      Our sense of touch can tell us whether an object is hot or cold. It gives an
idea about the object's temperature but we cannot measure the actual
                                             151
temperature of the body just by touching it. For the exact measurement of the
hotness of a substance, we require an instrument called a thermometer.
      Thermometers use some property of a substance, which changes
appreciably with the change of temperature.
Basic Thermometric Properties
       Some basic thermometric properties for a material suitable to construct
a thermometer are the following:
1.     It is a good conductor of heat.
2.     It gives quick response to temperature changes.
3.     It has uniform thermal expansion.
4.     It has high boiling point.
5.     It has low freezing point.
6.     It has large expansivity (low specific heat capacity).
7.     It does not wet glass.
8.     It does not vapourize.
9.     It is visible.
Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer
        We know that liquids expand on heating. So, expansion in the volume of a
liquid can be used for the measurement of temperature. This is known as
liquid-in-glass thermometer. One such liquid which is commonly used in
thermometers is mercury. Figure 7.6 shows a mercury thermometer. It is made of
glass. It has a bulb at one end filled with mercury.

       When the temperature rises, the mercury expands and moves up through
the narrow capillary tube in the form of a mercury thread. As shown in the given
figure 7.6, the position of the end of thread reads the temperature. Mercury is
opaque and can be easily seen due to its silvery colour. Alcohol is also a choice for
the thermometric liquid, but it must be coloured to make it visible.

temperatures, a small current flows across them. This in a thermocouple

kept at a fixed lower temperature, say by placing it in an ice bath at 0OC for
reference, the temperature of other junction at a higher temperature can be
measured using a millivolt meter by a calibrated scale on it (Fig. 7.8).
       This type of thermometer is particularly useful for very high temperatures
and also rapidly changing temperature as there is only a small mass of metal
(the junction) to heat up.
7.4 Sensitivity, Range and Linearity of Thermometers
        A thermometer is evaluated by its three key characteristics that are
sensitivity, range and linearity. They help determine the suitability of the
thermometer for specific use ensuring accurate and reliable measurement of
temperature.
Sensitivity
       Sensitivity of a thermometer refers to its ability to detect small changes in
the temperature of an object. For example, the minimum division on the scale of
a thermometer is 1°C. The accuracy of its temperature measurement will be 1°C.
On another thermometer the marks are 0.1°C apart. Hence, its accuracy will be
up to 0.1°C and said to be more sensitive. Its measurement will be more precise
than the measurement by a thermometer with an accuracy of 1°C.
Range
        This refers to the span of temperature, from low to high, over which the
thermometer can measure accurately. For example, a clinical thermometer
designed for human body temperature has a narrow or short range, say from
35°C to 45°C. A long-range thermometer is usually used for science experiments
in the laboratory with markings from −10°C to 110°C. The choice of liquid for

                                         155
thermometers put a lower and upper limit for the range of a thermometer. For
example, Mercury freezes at -39°C and boils at 357°C. Hence, we can construct
mercury in glass thermometers within this range. The marking scale depends on
desired range of measurement. For extremely low temperatures, alcohol is used.
Alcohol has a much lower freezing point about -112°C which increases its lower
limit for the range but it has lower upper limit as it boils at 78 °C.
Linearity
       This refers to a direct proportional relationship between the temperature
and scale reading across entire range of measurement. A good linear
thermometer should measure equal increments on the scale corresponding to
equal change in the temperature. It means that marking on the scale should be
evenly spaced over the whole range. High linearity means more consistent and
proportional scale readings over the entire range to ensure accuracy of
measurement.
7.5 Structure of A Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer
        A liquid-in-glass thermometer has a narrow and uniform capillary tube
having a small bulb filled with mercury or alcohol at its lower end. The thin wall of
the glass bulb allows quick conduction through glass to the liquid from a hot
object whose temperature is to be measured. Mercury being metal is a good
conductor and hence responds quickly to the change in temperature. The small
amount of liquid also responds more quickly to a change in temperature. The
quick response makes the device sensitive. Use of mercury is quite sensitive for
normal measurements. For greater accuracy, alcohol can be used as its
expansivity is six times more than mercury but it has range limitation to higher
temperature measurements due to its low boiling point (78°C).
        The uniformity of the narrow tube or bore ensures even expansion of the
liquid required to make the linear measuring scale. The choice of mercury allows
to use it over a long-range temperature due to its low freezing point and high
boiling point. It provides a fairly long range of measurement of temperature.

8.1 Magnetic Materials
      Magnetism is a force that acts at a distance upon magnetic materials.
These materials are attracted to magnets. These materials are called magnetic
materials. Let us perform an activity to test such materials.
Activity 1

       The teacher should divide the students into
groups and provide them permanent magnets to
perform this activity.
          Each group should collect some items made
of different materials such as copper wire, nickel ring,
glass bottle, paper clips, iron nail, eraser, wooden
ruler, plastic comb, etc. Place them on a table as shown
in figure. Bring the permanent magnet close to each
item one by one and observe which items are
attracted by the magnet and which are not. Make a list of magnetic and non magnetic
materials.
        Materials such as iron, nickel and cobalt will be attracted by the magnet. They are
magnetic materials. The materials such as brass, copper, wood, glass and plastic are not
attracted by the magnet. They are called non-magnetic materials.
        We will discuss different types of materials in detail later in this chapter.
For Your Information!
 Over 1000 years ago, the Greeks discovered a rock called lodestone or
 magnetite that could attract materials that contained iron. Also, if suspended
 from a string to rotate freely, it would always settle in north-south direction.
 This unique property led to form the basis of compass which was later on
 used for navigation on land and at sea.

Activity 2
         The teacher should facilitate each group to perform
this activity as per instructions.
1.   Place some iron filings scattered on the
     top of a card paper or a sheet of glass.                                       (b) Iron filings
2.   Move a magnet beneath the card paper,                                          attracted

8.2 Properties of Magnets
       The property of attracting magnetic materials by the magnets has been
discussed above. The magnets also exhibit the following properties.

1. Magnetic Poles                                                              North

                                                                 West
       I f a bar magnet is suspended                                               East

horizontally through a string and allowed to                         South
come to rest, it will point in north-south
direction. The end of the magnet that points
north is called the north magnetic pole (N)
                                                                        Fig. 8.1
and rhe end that points south is the south
magnetic pole (S) as shown in Fig. 8.1.

2. Attraction and Repulsion of Magnetic Poles
       When two freely suspended bar magnets are
placed close to each other, the two north poles will
repel each other (Fig. 8.2). So will the two south            Fig. 8.2
poles (Fig. 8.3).
       However, if the north pole of one is placed
near the south pole of the other, the poles will
                                                              Fig. 8.3
attract (Fig. 8.4 & Fig. 8.5). We can say that Like
poles repel and unlike poles attract.

3. Identification of a Magnet                                 Fig. 8.4

          To identify whether an object is a magnet or
simply a magnetic material, we can bring its one end
close to any pole of a suspended bar magnet. If it is
attracted, then we can conclude that the end of the               Fig. 8.5

object is either of opposite pole to that of the
suspended magnet or it is simply a magnetic material. Then we should bring the
same end of the object close to the other end of the suspended magnet. If the
object is again attracted, it is not a magnet but it is a magnetic material.
If it is repelled by the other end of the suspended magnet, then the object is a
magnet.
                    The repulsion between the like poles is
                       a real test to identify a magnet.

                                      163
4. Is Isolated Magnetic Pole Possible?
       If we break a bar magnet into two equal
pieces, can we get N-pole and S-pole separately?                   N                           S
No, it is not possible. Each piece will have its two
                                                                  N     S N     S N      S N       S
poles, i.e., N-pole and S-pole. Even if a magnet is
divided into thousands pieces, each piece will be a                           Fig. 8.6
complete magnet with its N, and S-poles (Fig.8.6).

8.3 Induced Magnetism
         Magnetic material such as iron or steel can be made a magnet. This is
known as magnetization. In other words, we can say that magnetism has induced
in it. You can perform an activity to observe this fact.
 Activity 3
       The teacher should facilitate each group to perform this activity as per instructions.
 1.    Take a magnetic compass. Put it on a table and see which end of its needle points north.
       The N-pole of the needle is usually coloured red.
 2.    Place a bar magnet on the table. Bring the compass near to its N-pole. In which direction
       does the N-pole of the needle stay?




  3.   Put the compass near to the S-pole of the bar magnet. In which direction does the N-pole
       of the needle stay this time?
  4.   Now place an iron nail having its head in contact with any pole of the bar magnet.



                                                            N          S

 5.    Put the compass near to the pointed end of an iron nail. Observe the direction in which
       N-pole of the needle settles. Has the nail become a magnet? Has magnetism been
       induced in it?
 6.    Take the bar magnet away from the nail. Again check the behaviour of the nail by bringing
       compass near to its ends. Does the magnetism vanish?
       From the above activity, we conclude that the S-pole of the true magnet induces N-pole
       in the near end of the piece of iron (nail) while the far end of the iron piece becomes S-
       pole as shown in the figure.
       It should be noted that the induced magnetism vanishes as the true magnet is
        removed.


                                                164
8.4 Temporary and Permanent Magnets
         Temporary magnets are the magnets that work in the presence of a
magnetic field of permanent magnets. Once the magnetic field vanishes, they
lose their magnetic properties. You have learnt something about a magnetic field
in lower classes. In the next chapter, we will study it in detail.
         Usually, soft iron is used to make temporary magnets. Paper clips, office
pins and iron nails can easily be made temporary magnets. Electromagnets are
also good examples of temporary magnets. You have already learnt different
uses of electromagnets.
         Permanent magnets retain their magnetic properties forever. These are
either found in nature or artificially made by placing objects made of steel and
some special alloys in a strong magnetic field for a sufficient time. There are
many types of permanent magnetic materials. For example cobalt, alnico and
ferrite.


 Activity 4

          The teacher should facilitate the groups to
 provide each a bar magnet, a stand with clamp, some
 small nails made of iron and also some nails of steel. He
 should further supervise them to perform the activity as
 per instructions.
 1. Clamp the bar magnet horizontally on the stand.
 2. Touch the head of an iron nail to anyone end of the
      magnet. It will be attracted and stick to the magnet.
      Touch another iron nail to the lower end of the first
      one, does it stick to it?
      Yes, it will, because the upper nail has become a
      magnet itself. Go on hanging iron nail one by one to
      make a chain until no more nails stay attached to the
      chain.
 3. Try to hang steel nails at the other end of the bar
      magnet to form a similar chain.
 4. Remove the chain of iron nails by pulling the topmost nail. Does the chain collapse?
 5. Remove the chain of steel nails in the same way. Does this collapse?
      You will observe that the chain of iron nails immediately collapses but the steel nails
      remain attached to each other for some time. This shows that the magnetism induced in
      the iron nails is temporary while that in the steel nails is permanent.




                                             165
8.5 Magnetic Fields
       When a magnet attracts a certain magnetic
material, it exerts some force to do so. Similarly, when it
attracts or repels a magnetic pole of another magnet, it
exerts a force on it. This force can be observed up to a
certain distance from the magnet that can be explained
by the concept of magnetic field around the magnet.

  A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where
  an other magnetic object experiences a force on it.

     The pattern of a magnetic field around a bar
magnet can be seen very easily by a simple experiment.                Fig. 8.7
        If iron filings are sprinkled on a thin glass plate placed over a bar magnet,
the filings become tiny magnets through magnetic induction. Now if the glass
surface is gently tapped, the filings form a pattern. This pattern is known as the
magnetic field pattern (Fig.8.5). This pattern can be better shown by lines that
correspond to the path of the filings. These lines are called magnetic lines of
force.
Magnetic lines of Force
       The magnetic lines of force around
a bar magnet can be drawn by using a
small compass. The needle of the compass
will move along the magnetic lines of force.
Figure. 8.8 shows the magnetic lines of
force around a bar magnet drawn by this
                                                               Fig. 8.8
method.Thecompass needle is
symbolized by an arrow being the north
pole (Fig. 8.9).
     The magnetic field at a point has both
a magnitude and a direction.                                      Fig. 8.9

             The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space
             is the direction indicated by the N-pole of a magnetic
             compass needle placed at that point.

                                        166
       Figure. 8.8 also shows that the field lines appear to originate from the
north pole and end on the south pole. Actually, the magnetic field extends in
space all around the magnet but the figure shows the field in one plane only.

Strength of the Magnetic Field
        The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the number of
magnetic lines of force passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the
lines. Thus, the magnetic field is stronger in regions where the field lines are
relatively close together and weaker where these are far apart. For example in
Fig. 8.10, the lines are closest together near north and south poles indicating that
the strength of the magnetic field is stronger in these regions. Away from the
poles, the magnetic field becomes weaker.

        In case the two magnets are placed close to each other, their combined
magnetic field can also be drawn by using the compass needle. Figure. 8.10 and
Fig. 8.11 show the patterns of the combined magnetic field of two magnets
lying with different orientations. In Fig. 8.11, point 'x' is called a neutral point
because the field due to one magnet cancels out that due to the other magnet.
Figure. 8.12 represents the field pattern of a horse-shoe magnet. The field is
almost uniform between the poles except near the edges.

8.6 Uses of Permanent Magnets
       There are many uses of permanent magnets such as:
1.     They are the essential parts of D.C motors, A.C and D.C electric generators.
2.     Permanent magnets are used in the moving coil loud-speakers.
3.     These are very commonly used in door catchers.
4.     Magnetic strips are fitted to the doors of refrigerators and freezers to
       keep the door closed tightly.
5.     They are commonly used to separate iron objects from different mixtures.
       Flourmills use permanent magnets to remove iron nails, etc. from the
       grains before grinding.
                                        167
6.     In the medical field, they are used to remove iron splinters from the eyes.
7.     A piece of permanent magnet is used to reset the iron pointer in a
       maximum and minimum thermometer.

Applications of Permanent Magnets
       Let us see, how some of the following devices use permanent magnets.

A.C Generator                                   Slip rings

       When a coil is rotated between the
                                                                                     I

magnetic field through the coil changes Carbon                   I

the coil (Fig.8.13). On connecting these
ends to an external circuit, an alternating                            I
current (A.C) flows through the circuit.                                   B
                                                         N                                 S
Electric motor is the reverse process of                                       I

a permanent magnet, it starts rotating.           Permanent

produce sound in the air.
8.7 Electromagnets
        Electromagnets are also a kind of temporary magnets. The following
activity will show how electromagnets can be made and tested.

                                       168
 Activity 5

        The teacher should divide the students into groups and facilitate them
 to perform this activity.
                                                                                 Iron
         Take a battery of two cells, a                 Thread                   Nail
 switch, an iron nail, cotton (or                                     Coil
 plastic) covered copper wire, thread
 and a few paper clips.
         Wind the wire over the iron
 nail to form a coil. Suspend the coil
 by means of thread tied to its centre.             Switch         Battery
 Connect ends of the wire to the
                                           Clips
 battery through the switch as shown
 in the figure.
        Keeping the switch OFF, bring some paper clips near to one end of the
 nail. Do they stick to the nail? Now turn the switch ON and again bring the
 paper clips near to the end of the nail. Do they stick this time? Does the nail
 behave like a magnet? Yes, the nail has become a magnet. Turn the switch OFF
 and see what happens to the clips. Do they fall down? What do you conclude
 from this activity?

       An iron nail or a rod becomes a magnet when an electric current
       passes through a coil of wire around it. It is called an electromagnet.

       When an electric current passes through the coil of wire, magnetic field is
produced inside the coil that magnetizes the iron nail. As we have observed that
the magnetic properties of an electromagnet are temporary, therefore, iron
object remains a magnet as long as the electric current passes through the coil.
When the current is stopped, it no longer remains a magnet.
       If we increase the number of cells in the battery or increase the number of
turns of the coil, we will observe that the strength of the magnetic field in each
case increases. This will be indicated by the more number of clips held by the nail
in these cases.

Uses of Electromagnets
        Electromagnets are used in electric bell, telephone receiver, simple
magnetic relay, circuit breaker, reed switches, cranes, tape recorder, maglev
trains and many other devices. Functions of some of them are described below:
                                          169
Magnetic Relay
        This is a type of switch which works with an electromagnet. It is an input
circuit which works with a low current for safety purpose. When it is turned ON it
activates another circuit which works with a high current.
        The input circuit supplies a small current to electromagnet. It attracts the
iron armature which is pivoted. The other end of the armature moves up and
pushes the metal contacts to join together which turn the high current-circuit
ON (Fig.8.15).
                                                                           Springy metal

Circuit Breaker
        A circuit breaker is designed to pass a certain maximum current through it
safely. If the current becomes excessive, it switches OFF the circuit. Thus, electric
appliances are protected from burning. As shown in Fig.8.16, inside a circuit
breaker, the current flows along a copper strip, through the iron armature and
coil of the electromagnet. The electromagnet attracts the armature. If the current
is large enough, the armature is detached from the copper strip and the circuit
breaks.                                   Armature       Pivot Spring

          A wonderful use of
electromagnets can be seen in the
Maglev trains. The maglev stands for a
magnetically levitated train. A maglev
uses forces that arise from induced
magnetism to levitate or float a few
centimetres above the guideway. That is
why, it does not need wheels and faces Guideway Rail
no friction. In Japan, it is known as a                       Arm

bullet train that can run up to a speed of
400 km per hour.                                   Levitation

move it forward. To push the train
forward, propulsion electromagnets are installed along the guideway and train. By push and
pull of these magnets the train moves forward.

Electromagnetic Cranes
         Huge electromagnets are used in
cranes at scrapyards, steel works and on
ships. These are so powerful that they can
lift iron and steel objects such as cars as
shown in Fig.8.18. After moving the heavy
objects to the required position, the
objects are released by just switching OFF
the current of the electromagnet.
                                                                     Fig. 8.18

8. 8 Domain Theory of Magnetism
       It is observed that the magnetic
field of a bar magnet is like the field
produced by a solenoid (long coil of wire)
carrying current (Fig. 8.19-a & b). It
suggests that all magnetic effects are due
                                                              Fig. 8.19(a)
to moving charges. In case of solenoid,
charges are moving in the wire. The
motion responsible for the magnetism in a
magnet is due to electrons within the
atoms of the material.                                                 Current
       We know that an electron is a                          Fig. 8.19(b)
charged particle. Also, each electron in an atom is revolving about the nucleus
and at the same time, it is spinning about an axis through it. The rotation and spin
both give rise to a magnetic field. Since there are many electrons in an atom, their
rotations and spins may be so oriented to strengthen the magnetic effects
mutually or to cancel the effects of one another. If an atom has some resultant
magnetic field, it behaves like a tiny magnet. It is called a magnetic dipole.

Paramagnetic Materials
        If the orbital and spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that
their fields support one another and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet, the
materials with such atoms are called paramagnetic materials such as aluminium
and lithium.

Diamagnetic Materials
        Magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the
electrons in an atom may add up to Zero. In this case, the atom has no resultant
field. The materials with such atoms are called diamagnetic materials. Some of
their examples are copper, bismuth, water, etc.

Ferromagnetic Materials
       There are some solid substances such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. in
which cancellation of any type does not occur for large groups of neighbouring
atoms of the order of 10¹⁶ because they have electron spins that are naturally
aligned parallel to each other. These are known as ferromagnetic materials.
                                        172
       The group of atoms in this type of material form a region of about 0.1 mm
size that is highly magnetized. This region is called a magnetic domain. Each
domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles.
Alignment of Domains
        The domains in a ferromagnetic material are
randomly oriented as shown in Fig.8.20 (a). The magnetic
fields of the domains cancel each other so the material           Fig. 8.20(a)
does not display any magnetism. However, an
unmagnetized piece of iron can be magnetized by
placing it in an external magnetic field provided by a
permanent magnet or an electromagnet.
        The external magnetic field penetrates the                Fig. 8.20(b)
unmagnetized iron and induces magnetism in it by causing two effects on the
domains. Those domains whose magnetism is parallel or nearly parallel to the
external magnetic field grow in size at the expense of other domains that are not
oriented. In addition, the magnetic alignment of the other domains rotates and
become oriented in the direction of the external field (Fig.8.20-b). As a result, the
iron is magnetized and behaves like a magnet having its own north and south
poles.
                                                           For Your Information!
       In soft iron, the domains are easily oriented on
                                                           The magnetism induced in a
applying an external field and return to random            ferromagnetic material can

oriented, retains the alignment. That is why, steel is     field. That is why, high field
used to make permanent magnets.                            electromagnets are made
       In non-ferromagnetic materials, such as             by using cores of soft iron of
aluminium and copper, the formation of magnetic            some other ferromagnetic

domains does not occur, so magnetism cannot be
induced into these substances.

8.9 Magnetization and Demagnetization
        There are two methods used for magnetizing a steel bar:
1.      Stroking
        In this method, magnetism is induced in a steel bar by using the magnetic
field of a permanent magnet. The steel bar can be stroked in two ways:
                                        173
(a)    Single Touch Method
A steel bar is placed on a horizontal surface. It is
stroked from one end to the other several times        Permanent
                                                       magnet
in the same direction using the same pole (say
N) of the permanent magnet. Every time the
magnet is lifted up sufficiently high on reaching
the other end of the bar (Fig. 8.21).                            Fig. 8.21
(b)    Double Touch Method                                Permanent      Permanent
       In this method, stroking is done from the          magnet         magnet

centre of the steel bar onwards with the unlike
poles of two permanent magnets at the same
time (Fig. 8.22). This method is more efficient
                                                                 Steel bar
than the first one.                                              Fig. 8.22
In both the cases, the poles produced at the ends
of magnetized steel bar after stroking are of the
opposite polarity to that of the stroking pole.
2.     Making a Magnet using Solenoid
       In this method, a steel bar to be
magnetised is placed inside a solenoid (long coil
of wire) as shown in Fig. 8.23. The solenoid       -                   +
                                                  Current           Current
should have several hundred turns of insulated            Fig. 8.23
copper wire. When direct current is passed
 through the solenoid, the steel bar becomes a magnet. The polarity of the
magnetised steel bar is found by applying Right hand Grip rule which is
stated as:
             Grip the solenoid with the right hand such that fingers
             are curled along the direction of current (positive to the
             negative terminal of the battery) in the solenoid, then
             the thumb points to the N-pole of the bar end.


Demagnetisation of Magnets
1.      Heating
        Thermal vibrations tend to disturb the order of the
domain. Therefore, if we heat a magnet strongly, the magnet
loses its magnetism very quickly (Fig. 8.24).                          Fig. 8.24

                                         174
2.     Hammering
       If we beat a magnet, the domains lose their
alignment and the magnet is demagnetised. It is also
called hammering (Fig. 8.25).
                                                                            Fig. 8.25

3.     Alternating Current
       When an alternating current (A.C) is flowing
through a long solenoid, a magnet moved out slowly
from inside of the solenoid is demagnetised (Fig. 8.26).                   AC
                                                                           Fig. 8.26


8.10 Applications of Magnets in Recording Technology
       Electromagnets have widely used in recording technology of sound,
video and data in the form of electrical signals through magnetization of a
magnetic material. Most common magnetic recording mediums are magnetic
tapes and disk recorders which are used not only to reproduce audio and video
signals but also to store computer data. These materials are usually coated with
iron oxide. Some other recordings mediums are magnetic drums, ferrite cores
and magnetic bubble memory. We will discuss the process of magnetic
recording on tapes and disks in some detail.

Magnetic Tape Recording
        Induced magnetism is used in the
process of magnetic tape recording.                A.C
Recording and playing head is a coil of wire
wrapped around an iron core. The iron core                                          Recording
has a horse-shoe shape with a narrow gap in                                         head
between its two ends. Audio and video tapes      Magnetic                                Tape

ferromagnetic material.                          Plastic backing            Fringe field penetrates

currents are sent to the head that becomes an                      N

electromagnet with a N-pole at one end and
                                                                       S

                                                              Fig. 8.27

                                       175
gap. Some of the field lines in the gap curved outward as shown in Fig. 8.27. The
curved part of the magnetic field called as fringe field penetrates magnetic
coating on the moving tape and induces magnetism in the coating. This induced
magnetism is retained when the tape leaves the vicinity of the recording head.
The reverse process changes the varying induced magnetism into varying
current that onward is converted into sound or picture.

Hard Disk Recording
        Hard disks are circular flat plates       Rotating
made of aluminium, glass or plastic and           magnetic           Read/write
                                                     disk              head
coated on both sides with iron oxide. Hard
disks can store terabyte of information.
                                              Voice coil
        A magnetic head is a small            positioner
electromagnet which writes a binary digit
(1 or 0) by magnetizing tiny spots on the
spinning disk in different directions and
reads digit by detecting the magnetization
direction of spots (Fig. 8.28). The term hard
disk is also used to refer to the whole of a               Fig. 8.28
computer's internal data storage.
        Magnetic disk devices have an advantage over tapes recorders. A disk unit
has the ability to read or write a recording instantly while locating a desired
information on tape may take many minutes.
        Electronic devices can be protected from strong magnetic effects by
enclosing them in the boxes made of soft iron. We will describe it in detail in the
next section.

8.11 Soft Iron as Magnetic Shield
                                                              Soft iron casing


        Softironhas high magnetic

of a material to allow the magnetic flux or                    Sensitive

lines of force through it when the material is
placed inside a magnetic field. When a piece
of soft iron is put into a magnetic field, it
g e ne ra t es a magnetic fi eld due to
magnetization.                                          External magnetic field

                                                             Fig. 8.29

                                       176
        If a sensitive magnetic device is enclosed in a casing of soft iron, the
magnetic flux gets established in the soft iron rather than the device. Thus, the
device is shielded from external magnetic field.
        Figure 8.29 can explain this phenomenon well. A soft iron casing (shell) is
placed inside a magnetic field produced by opposite poles of two bar magnets.
Since the magnetic permeability of the iron shell is higher than that of air, so the
magnetic flux is established in the soft iron. As a result, the device is protected
from the magnetic field. Usually, the casing is made with rounded corners to
facilitate the magnetic field line up easily.
        Soft iron is generally used in the cores of transformers and
electromagnets because of its high permeability. In case of an electromagnet,
the core of soft iron can be easily magnetized when current is passed around it
and quickly lost when current is stopped. That is why, electromagnets are widely
used in electric bells, loud speakers, picking and releasing iron scraps by the
cranes and in many more appliances. The sensitivity of a moving coil
galvanometer is also increased by placing a soft iron core inside the coil.

Science is a collective knowledge about the natural phenomena, processes and
events occurring around us. The process starts with asking a question, how and
why the things in the world behave as such. We try to look orderliness and
regularities among various phenomena apparently of diverse nature. Such study
of nature gave birth to a single discipline, known as Natural Philosophy now
known as science. There was a tremendous increase in the volume of scientific
knowledge at the beginning of nineteenth century. That made it necessary to
classify the study of nature basically into two main disciplines.
(i.)    The biological sciences which deal with the living things.
(ii.) The physical sciences which are about the study of non-living things.
        Physics is important and basic part of physical sciences beside other
disciplines such as chemistry and geology.
9.1 Scope of Physics                                      Do You Know?
       Physics is the fundamental science that deals
with the constituents of the universe, that is, matter,
energy, space, time and their mutual relationships and
interactions. It strives to understand how the universe
works, from the smallest subatomic particles to the
largest star and galaxies. We have studied some of the
basic properties of matter, energy and their mutual This toy which worked

       The time measures the sequence and durations of events. It is considered
fourth dimension. For example, oscillating motion such as that of a swinging
pendulum relies on the time interval that determine frequency of oscillations.
Another example is the time dilation which is a phenomenon discussed by
special theory of relativity where time passes slowly for an observer moving at
ultra-high speed compared to one relatively at rest. Physics explores how these
fundamental concepts are inter connected. For example, the theory of relativity
explains how space and time are not absolute quantities but are related to each
other. It describes the relationship between space and time and how they are
influenced by gravity and speed, for example, the bending of light around
                                       182

explains the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is how the
physics has applied its principles to wide variety of phenomena, from everyday
occurrences such as related to motion and heat to the extreme conditions found
in the universe.

         Computer graphics               problems.

9.4 Interdisciplinary Research
        Collaboration and interdisciplinary nature of science is essential for
addressing the complex issues and challenges of today. By working together and
sharing knowledge, scientist can achieve more significant breakthrough and
contribute to a deeper understanding of the natural and physical world around
us. It allows us to contribute to advance in technology, healthcare,
environmental issues and many other areas. We need collaborated efforts
because:
(I). Solution of complex issues requires multifacet expertise
        Many challenging issues, such as climate change, disease prevention and
treatment, sustainable energy solution are of diverse nature. It is difficult for one
discipline to address them adequately. Such as understanding and mitigating
climate change require knowledge for meteorology, oceanography, physics,
chemistry, biological and environmental sciences. Similarly, the health care
issues such as recent Covid epidemic involved combined efforts of expertise

                                         186
from biology, chemistry, physics, medical technologies and data science to
combat this challenge.
(ii). Interdisciplinary approaches foster innovation
       Combined different perspectives and methodologies evolve innovation
or out of box solutions. This approach can lead to novel insight and
breakthroughs that might not emerge working in isolation. For example, nano-
technology is a blend of physics, chemistry, material science and engineering to
create materials and devices at the nano-scale with unique applications in
medical, energy and electronics. In an other field of “artificial intelligence” the
development involves computer science, mathematical logic, neuroscience etc.
The collaboration across these fields enhanced the development of intelligence
systems and their applications.
(iii). Rapid sharing of knowledge and information across the globe
       Sharing and collaboration of knowledge across the globe brings rapid
advances in science. The online internet information exchanges, conferences
and workshops provide platforms bringing together researchers from different
fields to share their fresh findings, discussion and brainstorming new
approaches. Collaborated research projects and research journals are also
means of collaborate research.
       Interdisciplinary research and collaboration leads to a more holistic
understanding of challenging issues by interacting with different perspectives
such as that of environment and space exploration.

9.5 Scientific Method
        Scientific method is a systematic approach used to search for truth of an
issue and problem solving regarding natural and physical world. It is based on
the following steps.
1.      Identify or recognize an issue or a problem.
2.      Gather information through observations of its various aspects.
3.      Propose an explanation or a guess work known as hypothesis.
4.      Perform experiment or collect evidences to test the hypothesis.
5.      Record, organize and analyze gathered data, plotting and interpreting
        graphs to reach at a conclusion which is called a theory.
6.      Repeated tests of the theory to wide range of similar issues then lead
        towards the formulation of a law.
Some key steps are elaborated here.

                                       187
1. Observation
        The first step in scientific method is
to make observations of natural processes
and to collect the data about them. This
maybedone either by ordinary
observations or by obtaining the results
from different experiments. For example, it
is our common observation that shadow of
an opaque object is formed when it is
placed in the path of light coming from the
Sun or a lamp (Fig.9.1).                                       Fig. 9.1

2. Hypothesis
       On the basis of the data collected through observations or
experimentation, we can develop a hypothesis. This is done in order to test its
logical results, i.e., it is assumed that nature will act in a particular way under
certain specific circumstances. From the above example, we assume that
shadows of opaque objects are formed when they come in the path of light
because light travels in a straight line.

3. Experiment
       Experiment is an organized repeatable process which is used to test the
truth of a hypothesis.
       To verify the assumption made in the above example, four card boards,
each with a hole, are placed in a straight line, such that the hole in 1st card is in
front of a torch. When we see through the hole in cards, we can see the light of
the torch (Fig. 9.2-a). If any of these cards is displaced, we cannot see light
passing through (Fig. 9.2-b). Thus, this experiment proves that light travels in a
straight line.

5. Prediction
       After the careful analysis of a theory we can make predictions about
certain unknown aspects of nature. To verify the prediction, experiments are
designed to test the theory over and over again. If test result do not agree,
hypothesis is changed or rejected.

7. Law
        When a theory has been tested many times and generally accepted as
true, it is called a law. The law is such a statement regarding the behaviour of
nature which explains the observations and experiments of the past and can
predict about other aspects of nature. From the fact that light travels in a straight
line, we can predict that shadow of an opaque object, similar in shape, is formed
whenever it is placed in the path of light. For example, the shadow of a ball will be
round whereas the shadow of a rectangular block will be a rectangle After testing
the theory under different situations, this becomes a law of science that light
travels in a straight line.
        The theories or laws of physics are man made ideas about the way the
things work. They are liable to be disproved or modified with the future advances
in science which brings fresh facts and new insights about the natural and
physical world.

9.6 Scientific Base of Technologies and Engineering
          Science or to be more specific, physics plays a vital role being the core of
each invention based on physical laws and principles. Technology refers to the
methods and techniques developed by using scientific knowledge. It may be a
machine technology or a software programme of information technology. For
example,
    (i) Automobile technology is based on the principles of the
          thermodynamics.
    (ii) Radar technology is based on the detection and reflection principles of
          electromagnetic waves.
    (iii) Laser technology is based on the principles of atomic physics. It is widely
          used in medical diagnosis and treatment, metallurgy, industry,
          telecommunication and space exploration.
          Engineering is the process of applying various technologies and scientific
principles to design various instruments, tools and build things that help to meet
specific needs in every walk of life. Engineers also consider factors like cost
effectiveness and safety measures when designing various products. Examples
include:
    (I) A civil engineer designs a bridge that can withstand strong winds,
          earthquakes, intense weather conditions and heavy traffic.


                                         190
                                          8
    (ii) A software engineer designs a user friendly application of a smartphone.
    (iii) An aviation engineer looks for lighter material which can withstand
          sudden and severe disturbances and extreme weather conditions during
          the flight of an aeroplane.
          Though the science, technology and engineering fields seem distinct but
they often work together. Scientific discoveries lead to new technologies and
engineers rely on scientific knowledge for our benefits and comforts. They are
the potent for change in the outlook of mankind in shaping life style and
influencing our way of thinking.
